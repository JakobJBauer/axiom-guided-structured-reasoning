Think of this as a friendly guide to the tags and how they fit together — written conversationally, but keeping every logical rule exactly as it was.

[A story is [attr-7] if] The story has a story within a story. In plain terms: we tag a piece as [attr-7] when it literally contains a nested tale inside the main tale.

[A story is [attr-11] if] The story has the theme Magic. This is the label we give when magic is the thematic heartbeat of the work.

[A story is [attr-6] if] The story has a flashback. Use this whenever the narrative deliberately drops back into an earlier moment.

[A story is [attr-12] if] The story is about the arts. When the subject matter centers on artistic practice, creativity, artists, or art worlds, this tag applies.

[A story is [attr-10] if] The story is minimalist. Reserve [attr-10] for works with a sparse, pared-down aesthetic.

[A story is [attr-8] if] The story has circular narrative structure. We use this when the plot loops back on itself or ends where it began.

[A story is [attr-5] if exactly one of the following is true:]
- The story is [attr-7]
- The story is [attr-6]
Here we’re saying [attr-5] holds only when exactly one of those devices appears — either a nested story or a flashback, but not both at the same time.

[A story is [attr-4] if the truth value of [attr-7] equals the truth value of [attr-8]]
This one checks parity: [attr-4] is true when the presence (or absence) of a story-within-a-story matches the presence (or absence) of a circular narrative. They must align.

[A story is [attr-9] if the story's primary theme or topic is in the set {[attr-11], [attr-12]}]
If a story’s main identity is either magic or the arts, it belongs to [attr-9]. It’s a simple membership check: theme or topic falls in that set.

[A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:]
- Either of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-5]
  - The story is [attr-4]
- The story is not [attr-10] and (the story is [attr-8] or the story is [attr-6])
Here we’re defining a core category for complex narrative behavior. First, the story must satisfy one of the device-level conditions ([attr-5] or [attr-4]). Second, it must not be minimalist, and it must have either a circular structure or a flashback. Both of those top-level bullets must hold for [attr-3] to apply.

[A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:]
- The story is [attr-9]
- Either of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - The story is [attr-10]
Think of [attr-1] as an intersection: the piece is rooted in magic or the arts, and then it’s either structurally complex (per [attr-3]) or deliberately minimalist. One of those structural conditions must hold, in addition to being a [attr-9].

[A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:]
- The story is [attr-1]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is not [attr-6]
Finally, [attr-2] narrows things down further: it starts from [attr-1], and then requires a precise exclusive choice — either the device parity holds ([attr-4]) or the story lacks a flashback, but not both. Exactly one of those two conditions must be true.

That’s the full map: each label has a clear place, and the logical relationships — XOR, equality, “not,” “and,” “or,” and “exactly one” — are preserved exactly as specified. Use these descriptions while tagging and reasoning, and they’ll guide consistent, accurate annotations.
