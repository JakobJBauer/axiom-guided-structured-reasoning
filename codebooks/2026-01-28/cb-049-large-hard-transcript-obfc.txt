Interviewer: Let's go through this codebook together. First, can you define the simple labels—those that state a single property?

Expert: Sure. I'll read each one and then give a short conversational clarification.

Interviewer: What is [attr-3]?

Expert: A story is [attr-3] if The story has a cliffhanger.
Interviewer: So that tag is applied when the story literally ends on a cliffhanger. Got it.

Interviewer: [attr-20]?

Expert: A story is [attr-20] if The story is philosophical.

Interviewer: Great. Now let's move to the composite, logical definitions. Start with [attr-15].

Expert: Okay. Here’s the formal definition and how to read it.

A story is [attr-15] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-3]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is [attr-5]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-27]
  - The story is not [attr-3]

Interviewer: Let me clarify—so [attr-15] holds if any one of those three high-level cases is satisfied: it has a cliffhanger; exactly one of flashback or juxtaposition; or it uses discourse markers but does not have a cliffhanger. Right?

Expert: Exactly. The logical structure—either / exactly one / both with a negation—stays as written.

Interviewer: Next: [attr-9].

Expert: A story is [attr-9] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-13]
  - The story is [attr-14]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-28]
  - The story is [attr-27]

Interviewer: So to tag [attr-9], the story must start with an adjective or an adverb, and then exactly one of wh-questions or discourse markers must appear. Understood.

Interviewer: Now [attr-21].

Expert: A story is [attr-21] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - The story is not [attr-18]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-16]
  - The story is not [attr-20]

Interviewer: Note the first conjunction: it requires "in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]" and not minimalist. The second option is humorous but not philosophical. Clear.

Interviewer: [attr-22]?

Expert: A story is [attr-22] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-25]
  - The story is [attr-24]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-23]
  - The story is [attr-25]

Interviewer: So [attr-22] either requires both Problem-Solving and Humor, or exactly one of Deception or Problem-Solving. Got it.

Interviewer: [attr-11]?

Expert: A story is [attr-11] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- The story is [attr-6]

Interviewer: That enforces a mutually exclusive classification between low and high readability. Clear.

Interviewer: [attr-12]?

Expert: A story is [attr-12] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-11]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-17]
  - The story is not [attr-7]

Interviewer: So for READABILITY-IMPACT, you first must be in the readability class, and then either the story is lighthearted or it is not low-readability. Understood.

Interviewer: [attr-2]?

Expert: A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-15]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-9]
    - The story is not [attr-3]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-21]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-22]
    - The story is not [attr-20]

Interviewer: That's a two-part conjunction. The first part accepts either STRUCTURAL-DEVICES or a specific OPENING-PATTERN without cliffhanger. The second part accepts STYLE-TONE or THEMATIC-CORE provided it's not philosophical. Correct.

Expert: Correct. The "both of the following are true" at the top level requires one condition from each of those two big choices.

Interviewer: Now [attr-1]?

Expert: A story is [attr-1] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-12]
  - The story is [attr-21]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-16]
  - The story is [attr-18]

Interviewer: So to be audience-ready, either it meets both readability impact and style tone, or it is exactly one of humorous or minimalist. Clear.

Interviewer: Finally, [attr-10].

Expert: A story is [attr-10] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-2]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-1]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-22]
    - The story is not [attr-11]

Interviewer: So OPTIMAL-ARC requires an engagement pattern, plus either the story is audience-ready, or it has thematic core but lacks a readability class. That preserves the intended trade-off between engagement, audience fit, and thematic strength. Perfect.

Interviewer: Anything else we should note about reading and using this transcript-style codebook?

Expert: A couple of practical notes:
- Whenever you see "either of the following is true", treat that as logical OR.
- "Both of the following are true" is logical AND.
- "Exactly one of the following is true" is exclusive OR: one true, the other false.
- "The story is not [attr-8]" is logical negation.
- All node IDs appear exactly as [attr-26], and their relationships and formulas are unchanged from the original spec.

Interviewer: Thanks—that keeps the formal logic intact while making the definitions easy to talk through.

Expert: You're welcome. If you want, we can walk through an example story and annotate which nodes apply, step by step.
