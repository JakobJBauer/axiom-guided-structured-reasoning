Think of this as a quick, friendly guide to the tags we use when reading a story. I’ll keep the logic exactly as it is — the relationships, the little AND/OR/NOT rules — but say it in a more natural, easy-to-read way. Every tag appears with its original bracketed ID so you can match things up without any guesswork.

A story is [attr-9] if the story uses conditional mood.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if the story starts with a adverb.

That’s it — the same rules you already use, just laid out in a conversational flow so they’re quicker to read and easier to apply when you’re tagging and reasoning about stories.
