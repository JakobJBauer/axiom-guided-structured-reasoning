In a sunlit alcove of the anthological garden, where catalogues hum like bees and each tag blooms with a meaning, there lives a delicately kept codebook. Think of it as a map drawn in ink and petals, guiding gentle readers and meticulous annotators through the scent-laden paths of story traits. Below, each entry is given in full bloom — an evocative description to delight the mind while keeping every stitch of logic and structure exactly where it must be. Note: the bracketed node identifiers remain faithful and unchanged, like labels nailed to the trunks of enchanted trees.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if the story is playful — that is, if it wears a jaunty hat of mischief, delights in whimsical turns, and invites the reader to smile as it skips along the page.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if the story is modern — possessing the sensibilities, references, or tonal cadences associated with contemporary life, so that it feels rooted in the present moment.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if the story starts with an adjective — opening its first breath with a descriptive word that colors the very air of the narrative from the outset.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if the story uses discourse markers — employing connective signposts (like "however," "therefore," "meanwhile," and their kin) that guide the reader through transitions and the architecture of argument or narration.

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if the story has Checkhov's gun — that telling detail or planted element which, though seemingly modest at first, is destined to play a necessary role later in the tale.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-4]

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is either [attr-6] or [attr-7]
- The story is [attr-2]

Thus the garden keeps its order: each label a petal, each relationship a vine. The logic remains inviolate — the same branches and crossings that a careful annotator relies upon — while the language here lingers, ornate and welcoming, like an invitation to stroll and reason beneath the shade of precisely named trees.
