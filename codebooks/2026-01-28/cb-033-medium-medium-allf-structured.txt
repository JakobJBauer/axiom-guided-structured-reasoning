Codebook — Structured View

Overview
- Purpose: Present each labeling rule clearly and hierarchically so annotators can reason about labels step by step.
- Note: All node IDs are shown exactly in [BRACKET] format and logical constructions (Not, And, Or, Exactly one, Both, Either) are preserved verbatim.

Atomic (single-condition) labels
- [THEME-HUMOR]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-HUMOR] if The story has the theme Humor

- [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS] if The story is about lost civilizations

- [STYLE-PLAYFUL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-PLAYFUL] if The story is playful

- [STYLE-SURREAL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-SURREAL] if The story is surreal

- [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
  - Definition: A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if The story uses discourse markers

- [LOW-READABILITY]
  - Definition: A story is [LOW-READABILITY] if The story has readability score below 86.4

- [STYLE-CLASSIC]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-CLASSIC] if The story is classic

- [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if The story is philosophical

- [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] if The story has a cliffhanger

- [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if The story starts with a preposition

Composite labels (logical combinations)
- [TONE-MIX]
  - Primary statement: A story is [TONE-MIX] if either of the following is true:
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [STYLE-PLAYFUL]
      - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [STYLE-SURREAL]
      - The story is not [STYLE-CLASSIC]
  - How to evaluate:
    - First check exclusive choice: is exactly one of [STYLE-PLAYFUL] or [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] present?
    - If not, check the conjunction: is the story [STYLE-SURREAL] and at the same time not [STYLE-CLASSIC]?
    - If either block is satisfied, label [TONE-MIX].

- [PRESENTATION-CRITERIA]
  - Primary statement: A story is [PRESENTATION-CRITERIA] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is in the following set:
      - [THEME-HUMOR]
      - [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is equal to [THEME-HUMOR]
        - The story is not [LOW-READABILITY]
    - Or the story is [TONE-MIX]
  - How to evaluate (stepwise):
    - Step 1 (required): Confirm the story belongs to the set listed (either [THEME-HUMOR] or [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]).
    - Step 2 (required): Verify that at least one of the following holds:
      - The story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER], or
      - Both of: the story is equal to [THEME-HUMOR] and the story is not [LOW-READABILITY], or
      - The story is [TONE-MIX].
    - If both Step 1 and Step 2 are true, assign [PRESENTATION-CRITERIA].

Quick reference / decision hints
- Treat each atomic label as a single, directly observable property.
- For [TONE-MIX], remember the “either” structure: it accepts either an exclusive playful/philosophical signal, or a surreal-but-not-classic combination.
- For [PRESENTATION-CRITERIA], both the set-membership condition and the secondary condition must hold; the secondary condition itself allows multiple alternative paths (cliffhanger; humor with acceptable readability; or tone mix).

End notes
- No node IDs or logical relationships have been changed.
- The structure is intended to guide annotators through a clear evaluation order: check atomic labels first, then composite rules using the preserved logical operators.
