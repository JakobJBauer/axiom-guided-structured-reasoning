In a quiet alcove of an old library of tales, where dust motes dance like wayward thoughts and candles breathe soft light over brittle pages, there lives a codebook. It is not merely a ledger of labels but a map — a delicate filigree of rules and relationships that helps readers and annotators discern the soul of a story. Treat this as that venerable manuscript rephrased for a more lyrical audience: the logic remains steadfast, the node names remain written as runes in brackets, and the connections between them are preserved exactly as they were carved. Read on, and let each entry bloom into description and meaning without altering a single structural thread.
