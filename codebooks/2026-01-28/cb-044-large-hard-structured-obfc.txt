Overview — how to use this codebook
- Purpose: Define clear, testable labels (nodes) for annotating stories.
- Reading rules:
  - Each node ID appears exactly in [attr-3] form; treat it as an atomic predicate (e.g., “The story is [attr-25]”).
  - Composite nodes state logical conditions using:
    - “Both of the following are true:” (logical AND)
    - “Either of the following is true:” (logical OR)
    - “Exactly one of the following is true:” (exclusive OR)
    - “All of the following are true:” (universal AND)
    - Negation is expressed with “not”
  - Do not change node IDs or the logical relationships when applying these rules.

Composite nodes — structured definitions and decision trees
- [attr-10]
  - A story is [attr-10] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [attr-7]
    2. Either of the following is true:
       - The story is [attr-14]
       - The story is [attr-13]
  - Practical note: This captures juxtaposition that coincides with a prepositional start or with being very short.

- [attr-11]
  - A story is [attr-11] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [attr-10]
    2. Exactly one of the following is true:
       - The story is [attr-27]
       - The story is [attr-17]
  - Practical note: This refines [attr-10] by requiring a mutually exclusive choice between superlatives and a minimalist style.

- [attr-2]
  - A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [attr-25]
    2. Either of the following is true:
       - The story is [attr-18]
       - The story is [attr-11]
  - Practical note: This labels arts-focused stories that are either philosophical in tone or employ the juxtaposed-superlative pattern.

- [attr-9]
  - A story is [attr-9] if both of the following are true:
    1. Either of the following is true:
       - The story is [attr-22]
       - The story is [attr-15]
    2. All of the following are true:
       - The story is not [attr-17]
       - Exactly one of the following is true:
         - The story is [attr-16]
         - The story is [attr-27]
  - Practical note: This captures humor-oriented pieces that are not minimalist and that choose exactly one of two expressive modes (lighthearted vs. superlative).

- [attr-1]
  - A story is [attr-1] if either of the following is true:
    - Option A (conjunctive):
      - Both of the following are true:
        1. The story is [attr-5]
        2. Either of the following is true:
           - The story is [attr-21]
           - The story is [attr-23]
    - Option B (exclusive choice):
      - Exactly one of the following is true:
        - The story is [attr-19]
        - The story is [attr-20]
  - Practical note: This node groups morally framed kindness/helping narratives with an alternate mutually exclusive pairing of deception vs. hardship.

- [attr-4]
  - A story is [attr-4] if both of the following are true:
    1. Either of the following is true:
       - Sub-option 1 (conjunction):
         - Both of the following are true:
           - The story is [attr-2]
           - The story is [attr-1]
       - Sub-option 2 (exclusive choice):
         - Exactly one of the following is true:
           - The story is [attr-9]
           - The story is [attr-24]
    2. Either of the following is true:
       - Pair A:
         - Both of the following are true:
           - The story is [attr-26]
           - The story is [attr-6]
       - Pair B:
         - Both of the following are true:
           - The story is [attr-13]
           - The story is [attr-8]
  - Practical note: This final composite identifies stories that combine an artful/affective core (either the artful-philosophical + altruistic axis or an exclusive choice between humorous hybrid vs. giant-creature focus) with one of two structural/readability outcomes (time-travel circularity, or short + highly readable).

Quick annotation checklist (practical workflow)
- Step 1: Mark all atomic nodes that apply (use the exact [attr-12] form).
- Step 2: Evaluate composite nodes in bottom-up order:
  - Resolve [attr-10] → then [attr-11] → [attr-2]
  - Resolve humor cluster: [attr-9]
  - Resolve altruism cluster: [attr-1]
  - Finally evaluate [attr-4] using the results above plus structural nodes.
- Step 3: Apply negation exactly as written (e.g., “The story is not [attr-17]” must be satisfied where specified).
- Step 4: When “Exactly one of the following is true” appears, ensure exclusivity — confirm that only one of the listed sub-nodes holds.

Reminder
- Do not change node IDs, logical connectors, or add/remove nodes. This document reorganizes the presentation for clarity only; the underlying logic is unchanged.
