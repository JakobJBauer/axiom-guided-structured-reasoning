A story is [READABILITY-CLASS] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [LOW-READABILITY]
- The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]

Think of [ENGAGEMENT-PATTERN] as the story’s magnetic field: it needs structural hooks or a particular opening pattern without cliffhangers, and it must carry the right stylistic tone or a thematic core that is not philosophical.

[AUDIENCE-READY]
A story is [AUDIENCE-READY] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [READABILITY-IMPACT]
  - The story is [STYLE-TONE]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
  - The story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
[AUDIENCE-READY] is the polish at the end: either readability impact and tone align, or the story wears exactly one of two styles — humorous or minimalist — that makes it ready for its readers.

[OPTIMAL-ARC]
A story is [OPTIMAL-ARC] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [ENGAGEMENT-PATTERN]
- either of the following is true:
