Imagine a quiet archive where every story waits to be known by a handful of precise names. In that archive, each label is a small charm that a tale earns by doing something very specific. Below I tell the tale of those labels — a little story about how a story can become one thing or another — and then, to keep the rules sharp and dependable, I restate the exact definitions that govern them.

The flashback charm is simple and ancient: when a narrative tilts its gaze backward and lets us live a past scene again, it wears the [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] token. It’s a single, unmistakable sign that the timeline has been folded.

A story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] if The story has a flashback

Some stories invite us into a conversation. When a narrator or character asks the classic who/what/where/when/why/how questions — the wh-questions that probe and poke — the tale carries the [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] badge.

A story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] if The story uses wh-questions

Other stories steer us with signposts — words and phrases that stitch sentences and ideas together, guiding our attention and signaling shifts. When a narrative leans on those connective cues, it earns the [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] mark.

A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if The story uses discourse markers

Sometimes a story chooses a single conversational trick: it either peppers itself with wh-questions, or it threads the flow with discourse markers — but not both. When exactly one of those two features appears, the story is called [INTERACTIVE]. It’s a tidy, exclusive decision: one path or the other.

A story is [INTERACTIVE] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
- The story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]

Other tales are layered in a different way. If a story reaches backward with a flashback and, importantly, it is not wearing that conversational [INTERACTIVE] badge, then it becomes something more complex: [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]. Here the two requirements must hold together — the presence of a flashback and the absence of interaction — forming a distinct narrative class.

A story is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
- The story is not [INTERACTIVE]

Finally, there’s a special shelf for tales that stand apart for simple, clear reasons. A story belongs to [SPECIAL-CASE] if it falls into one of two situations: it is either one of the two named categories { [INTERACTIVE], [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] }, or it is simply the kind that reaches back in time on its own, equal to [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]. That set of circumstances collects the defined outliers and gives them a tidy home.

A story is [SPECIAL-CASE] if either of the following is true:
- The story is in the set { [INTERACTIVE], [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] }
- The story is equal to [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]

And so the archive remains organized: each story wears its label honestly, according to these exact rules. The narrative above should help you remember the relationships; the lines that follow each paragraph keep the logic precise and ready for annotation.
