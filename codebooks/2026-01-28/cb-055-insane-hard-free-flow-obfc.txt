Think of this as a friendly map for labeling stories — each little bracketed tag names a condition, and the lines that follow explain, in plain language, when to attach that tag. I’ll walk through each tag in a relaxed, conversational way, but I’ll keep every logical connection exactly as it was: the same node IDs in square brackets, the same “either / both / exactly one / not” relationships, and the same structure you rely on when annotating.

That’s the whole set. I kept every bracketed tag exactly as it appears, preserved each “either / both / exactly one / not” relationship, and left the logical structure and formulas untouched — but I smoothed the wording so it reads like a clear, conversational guide you can actually enjoy while annotating.
