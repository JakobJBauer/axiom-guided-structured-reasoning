I'll walk you through this codebook in a more conversational, free-flow voice while keeping every technical detail exactly where it belongs. The node IDs remain unchanged in [BRACKET] form, and all logical relationships—Not, And, Or, Exactly one, and so on—are preserved exactly as in the original. Think of this as a friendly guide that gently explains what each label means, then repeats the precise logical rules you need for annotation.

[STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
Call a story [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] when its overall tone is lighthearted — playful, breezy, or gently amusing. In short: if the story is lighthearted, it gets this tag.

[STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
Tag a story [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] when it leans into philosophical ideas, reflections, or questions. If the story is philosophical, it’s [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL].

[TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS]
Use [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS] for stories that take place in or are centrally about enchanted, uncanny, or distinctly magical lands. If the story is about magical lands, it’s [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS].

[USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
If a story explicitly uses wh-questions (who, what, where, when, why, how), label it [USES-WH-QUESTIONS].

[SHORT-STORY]
When the whole piece is concise — under 160 words — mark it [SHORT-STORY].

[THEME-KINDNESS]
If kindness is a core theme of the tale, assign [THEME-KINDNESS].

[MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
When the story is broken into more than six paragraphs, use [MANY-PARAGRAPHS].

[USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
If the narrative makes use of the conditional mood (would, could, might, etc.), give it [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD].

[THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
If problem-solving drives the story’s theme — characters working out puzzles, challenges, or obstacles — mark [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING].

[THEME-GROWTH]
When growth (personal, moral, or otherwise) is a clear theme, label the story [THEME-GROWTH].

[STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
If the very first word of the story is a preposition (in, on, under, before, etc.), tag it [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION].

[TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
Use [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES] when giant creatures are a central subject of the story.

[STYLE-MODERN]
If the story reads as modern in style — contemporary voice, modern settings or sensibilities — call it [STYLE-MODERN].

[STYLE-CLASSIC]
If the story has a classic style — timeless structure, older conventions, or a classic voice — mark it [STYLE-CLASSIC].

[THEME-MAGIC]
When magic itself is an explicit theme, use [THEME-MAGIC].

[TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]
If the story is about lost civilizations, ancient ruins, or rediscovered cultures, tag [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS].

[HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
If a flashback appears in the narrative, give it [HAS-A-FLASHBACK].

[TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
Stories centered on hidden treasures, secret hoards, or buried riches should carry [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES].

[NON-LIGHTHEARTED]
A story is [NON-LIGHTHEARTED] if the story is not [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]. In other words, apply this when the story is explicitly not lighthearted.

[MODERN-XOR-CLASSIC]
A story is [MODERN-XOR-CLASSIC] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [STYLE-MODERN]
- The story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]

[MAGICAL-ADVENTURE]
Think of [MAGICAL-ADVENTURE] as a special kind of adventure that must meet both of these conditions:
- The story is [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEME-MAGIC]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
    - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]

[HIDDEN-LOST-ADVENTURE]
Label a story [HIDDEN-LOST-ADVENTURE] when it fits either of these possibilities:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
  - The story is [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
  - The story is [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]

[QUEST-STYLE]
Use [QUEST-STYLE] for stories that have a wh-question device and either a conditional mood or begin with a preposition:
- [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] is in the set of devices the story uses (it explicitly uses wh-questions)
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]

[EPIC-GROWTH-ARC]
An [EPIC-GROWTH-ARC] is a tightly specified kind of growth story. Two big requirements must both be met:
- The set of themes in the story is equal to the set containing [THEME-KINDNESS] and [THEME-GROWTH]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
    - The story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
    - The story is not [SHORT-STORY]

[AMALGAM-OF-ADVENTURE]
An [AMALGAM-OF-ADVENTURE] happens in one of two ways:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [MAGICAL-ADVENTURE]
  - The story is [HIDDEN-LOST-ADVENTURE]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
  - The story is [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]

[AMBIGUOUS-MAGICAL-TALE]
Finally, [AMBIGUOUS-MAGICAL-TALE] captures a particular, layered combination. A story is this if either of these two larger blocks applies:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [AMALGAM-OF-ADVENTURE]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [MODERN-XOR-CLASSIC]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
      - The story is [THEME-MAGIC]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [EPIC-GROWTH-ARC]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is not [NON-LIGHTHEARTED]
    - The story is [QUEST-STYLE]

That’s the whole codebook, rewritten in a friendlier flow but keeping every ID, every logical condition, and every relationship just as originally specified. Use these labels exactly as defined when annotating or reasoning about stories.
