Reference and notation
- Convention: The expression "A story is [attr-21]" denotes that the predicate identified by [attr-21] evaluates to true for the given story.
- Logical connectors used in definitions: "all of the following are true:", "both of the following are true:", "either of the following is true:", "exactly one of the following is true:", and negation via "not". These reflect the intended Boolean structure and must be preserved when applying the predicates.

- Apply these predicates deterministically: evaluate atomic predicates first, then compute composite predicates using the exact Boolean composition specified above. Preserve the negations and quantifiers ("either", "both", "all", "exactly one") as given when performing automated or manual annotation.
