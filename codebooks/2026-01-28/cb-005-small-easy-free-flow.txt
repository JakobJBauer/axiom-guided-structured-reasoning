Think of this as a friendlier, more conversational tour through the same codebook — every label and logical link stays exactly where it was, only the wording around them relaxes into a more natural voice.

[USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if the story uses discourse markers. In other words, when a narrative relies on connective words and phrases — “however,” “meanwhile,” “on the other hand,” and the like — we mark it with this label.

[HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
A story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] if the story has juxtaposition. If the story places contrasting elements side by side to highlight differences or surprising similarities, that’s what this tag captures.

[TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
A story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES] if the story is about mystical creatures. Use this whenever the narrative centers on beings of myth, magic, or the supernatural.

[HAS-A-RED-HERRING]
A story is [HAS-A-RED-HERRING] if the story has a Red Herring. This one flags a deliberate misdirection or false lead woven into the plot.

[TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
A story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES] if the story is about giant creatures. When enormous beings are a primary focus — that’s when this label applies.

[FANTASTICAL-JUXTAPOSITION]
A story is [FANTASTICAL-JUXTAPOSITION] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
- The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
So, when mystical creatures are central and the narrative explicitly sets contrasting elements side by side, the story fits this combined category.

[GIANT-MISDIRECTION]
A story is [GIANT-MISDIRECTION] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
- The story is [HAS-A-RED-HERRING]
This label goes on tales that focus on giant creatures and also include a red herring — the large-scale focus plus an intentional plot mislead.

That’s it — same precise structure and logic, just written in a smoother, more conversational tone so it’s easier to read and use while you annotate.
