In the hushed library of classification, where each label is a polished talisman and every rule a gentle compass, this little codebook unfurls like a gilded map. Imagine an archivist who loves metaphor and meaning, cataloguing tales by their heartbeat and grammar. Below you will find the exact logical landmarks — unchanged in structure, exact in identification — presented with a flourish of description to guide annotators with both precision and delight.

[USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
A story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] if The story uses perfect aspect
- Practical note: mark this when a tale draws on the perfect aspect — those lyrical threads of have/has/had + past participle — stitching past events to present reflection. Think of it as a narrator who tends a garden of completed deeds and watches their flowers still scent the air.

[TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
A story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] if The story is about cultural traditions
- Practical note: apply this label when a story dwells on rituals, customs, inherited practices, or communal rites — the woven patterns of society that pass from hand to hand like heirloom cloth.

[TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
A story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] if The story is about the arts
- Practical note: use this when a tale centers on artistic expression — music, painting, dance, theater, craftsmanship — the tender ateliers of human imagination and skill.

[STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
A story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] if The story is lighthearted
- Practical note: affix this to stories that float on a buoyant breeze — playful, cheerful, gentle in tone, where amusement or easy warmth is the prevailing mood.

[ARTS-TRADITIONAL]
A story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
- The story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
- Practical note: this is the elegant overlap where artistic practice and age-old custom meet — imagine traditional dances performed to ancestral tunes, or craftsmen preserving a lineage of technique. Both elements must be present for this label to bloom.

[NOSTALGIC-ARTS]
A story is [NOSTALGIC-ARTS] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL]
- The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
- The story is not [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
- Practical note: assign this when a tale inhabits the reverent hush of memory. It treats traditional arts, uses the perfect aspect to look back upon completed moments, and carries a tone that is wistful or solemn rather than breezy. The combination evokes echoes of what once was, treasured and tinged with longing.

[LIGHT-ARTS-TRADITION]
A story is [LIGHT-ARTS-TRADITION] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL]
- The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
- Practical note: this label fits those delightful narratives where heritage and artistry are celebrated with a playful smile — festivals, communal dances, or age-old songs told with warmth and levity.
