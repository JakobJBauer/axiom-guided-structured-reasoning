Definition: The predicate [attr-12] is true for a story when the text employs grammatical perfect aspect (e.g., forms constructed with auxiliary perfect markers such as "has/have/had + past participle").

[attr-3]
Definition: The predicate [attr-3] is true for a story when the narrative includes at least one flashback sequence (a retroactive scene or memory that interrupts present chronology).

[attr-5]
Definition: The predicate [attr-5] is true for a story when the narrative employs juxtaposition (placement of contrasting elements in proximity for effect).

[attr-9]
Definition: The predicate [attr-9] is true for a story when the overall tone is lighthearted (playful, unserious, or pleasantly buoyant).

[attr-7]
Definition: The predicate [attr-7] is true for a story if and only if all of the following conditions hold:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-2]
  - The story is [attr-3]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-5]
  - The story is [attr-12]
- The story is not [attr-9]
- At least one of the story's structural features is in the set { [attr-2], [attr-3], [attr-5] }

Commentary: This node constitutes a conjunctive predicate that requires (1) presence of either a cliffhanger or a flashback, (2) an exclusive choice between juxtaposition and perfect aspect, (3) exclusion of a lighthearted style, and (4) confirmation that at least one of the enumerated structural features is present.

[attr-1]
Definition: The predicate [attr-1] is true for a story if and only if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- Both of the following are true:
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-11]
    - The story is [attr-4]
  - The presence of [attr-10] equals the presence of [attr-8]

Commentary: This node is a higher-order conjunction. It requires that the story satisfy [attr-7] and, additionally, that the story either contains the theme of kindness or a moral lesson, and that the truth value of [attr-10] is identical to the truth value of [attr-8] (i.e., both present or both absent).
