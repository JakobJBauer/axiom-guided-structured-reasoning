Codebook — Technical Definitions and Annotation Specifications

Overview
This document defines a set of binary annotation predicates used to label narrative texts. Each predicate is represented by its identifier in bracketed form (e.g., [attr-2]). A predicate is considered true for a given story when the specified condition is satisfied. Composite predicates are defined by logical combinations of other predicates; these logical relationships are preserved verbatim.

Node definitions

[attr-2]
- Predicate: [attr-2]
- Definition: This predicate evaluates to true if, and only if, the first lexical token of the story is a preposition.
- Operationalization: Inspect the initial token of the story; annotate true if that token is classified as a preposition according to standard syntactic categories (POS tag: preposition). Annotate false otherwise.

[attr-7]
- Predicate: [attr-7]
- Definition: This predicate evaluates to true if the story contains explicit discourse markers (connectives or transitional expressions used to organize discourse).
- Operationalization: Scan the story for tokens or phrases that function as discourse markers (e.g., transitional connectives, sequence markers, contrastive markers). If at least one discourse marker is present, annotate true; otherwise annotate false.

[attr-3]
- Predicate: [attr-3]
- Definition: This predicate evaluates to true when the narrative content of the story exhibits the theme of deception (intentional misleading, trickery, fraud, or concealment as a central element).
- Operationalization: Determine whether deception is a demonstrated theme within the narrative (central or prominent). If deception is present as a thematic element, annotate true; otherwise annotate false.

[attr-5]
- Predicate: [attr-5]
- Definition: This predicate evaluates to true if the story’s subject matter concerns magical or fantastical lands (settings characterized by supernatural or otherwise nonmundane properties).
- Operationalization: Assess the primary setting or topic of the story; annotate true if it plausibly concerns magical lands, false if not.

[attr-4]
- Predicate: [attr-4]
- Definition: This predicate evaluates to true if the story addresses cultural traditions (rituals, customs, heritage practices, or communal observances).
- Operationalization: Identify whether the narrative centers on cultural traditions. Annotate true when such content is present; otherwise annotate false.

[attr-6]
- Predicate: [attr-6]
- Definition: This predicate evaluates to true if the story concerns the arts (visual arts, performing arts, literature, music, or other artistic practices).
- Operationalization: Determine whether the story’s topic is related to artistic disciplines or practices. Annotate true if it is; otherwise annotate false.

[attr-1]
- Predicate: [attr-1]
- Definition: This composite predicate evaluates to true when all of the following constituent predicates are true:
  - The story is [attr-5]
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - The story is [attr-6]
- Logical structure: [attr-1] = [attr-5] AND [attr-3] AND [attr-6]
- Operationalization: Compute the truth value of each constituent predicate as defined above. Annotate [attr-1] as true only if every constituent predicate is true; otherwise annotate false.

Annotation guidance (procedural)
- Each predicate is binary (true / false).
- Use the defined operationalizations to make determinations; when in doubt, prefer conservative judgments (i.e., annotate false unless the criterion is clearly satisfied).
- For composite predicates, do not infer truth from partial satisfaction; all listed constituents must be true for a composite to be true.
- Preserve the predicate identifiers exactly as shown when recording annotations.
