Think of this codebook as an old map in a storyteller's satchel: each label is a signpost, and each signpost tells you exactly how to recognize a kind of tale. Below, the characters—the tags—introduce themselves and explain, in plain and sometimes playful language, the rules that give them life. The logical bones remain unchanged; only the narration around them is warm and human.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if the story starts with an adjective.
- Picture the very first word of a tale: if it sits there as an adjective, then the label [attr-4] slips quietly onto that story's shoulder.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if the story starts with a noun.
- If the opening word announces itself as a noun, then the tale wears the badge [attr-5].

[attr-8]
A story is [attr-8] if the story is lighthearted.
- This is the tag for stories that dance and grin; when a tale's tone keeps things airy and cheerful, it claims [attr-8].

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] if the story is surreal.
- When a story slips into odd dream-maps and unexpected turns, the [attr-9] name is its companion.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if the story is humorous.
- If a tale invites laughter, irony, or comic timing, it earns the [attr-7] label.

[attr-11]
A story is [attr-11] if the story has the theme Problem-Solving.
- When a plot revolves around puzzles, obstacles, or clever fixes, the theme [attr-11] applies.

[attr-10]
A story is [attr-10] if the story has the theme Deception.
- If trickery, concealment, or double meanings drive the plot, then the story wears [attr-10].

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-4]
- The story is [attr-5]
- Imagine a crossroads where a tale can begin with either an adjective or a noun—but not both. When exactly one of those openings is true, the tale becomes [attr-3].

[attr-12]
A story is [attr-12] if either of the following is true:
- The story's style is in the set { [attr-8], [attr-7] }
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-9]
  - The story is not [attr-10]
- Think of [attr-12] as a spark of whimsy: it flickers on either when the style is light or funny, or when a surreal story keeps its mischief honest (surreal but not deceptive).

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-10]
- The story is [attr-11]
- This tag gathers tales that pivot around cunning or challenges—deception or problem-solving.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if the following equality holds:
- [attr-8] = [attr-7]
- Here is a strict ledger: the label [attr-6] applies exactly when the two style tags, [attr-8] and [attr-7], are equal—when a story's lightheartedness and humor stand in perfect balance.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-3]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-12]
  - The story is [attr-2]
- A complex story is a careful construction: it must begin in exactly one recognized way (adjective or noun), and then it must choose precisely one path—either the playful lane or the lane of deception/problem. If the tale fits both layers of this test, it earns the ribbon [attr-1].

And so the map closes but remains ready: each bracketed name is a rule and a promise, guiding annotators and readers to tag stories with clarity—and a touch of storybook charm.
