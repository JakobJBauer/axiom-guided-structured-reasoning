Codebook — structured view for annotation

Purpose
- Provide concise, unambiguous rules for assigning the labels below.
- Each label is defined by a logical rule that must be followed exactly.
- Keep the node IDs in [attr-1] format and keep all logical operators and relationships unchanged.

Nodes (definitions and annotation checks)

1) [attr-7]
- Definition:
  - A story is [attr-7] if the story uses superlative forms.
- Annotator check:
  - Look for superlative adjectives/adverbs (e.g., words that mark highest degree such as “biggest,” “most,” “least,” “best,” “worst”).

2) [attr-6]
- Definition:
  - A story is [attr-6] if the story is about lost civilizations.
- Annotator check:
  - The main subject or theme concerns ancient or vanished societies, ruins, or civilizations that have been lost.

3) [attr-4]
- Definition:
  - A story is [attr-4] if the story starts with a noun.
- Annotator check:
  - The very first token of the story is a noun (proper or common). Verify initial word class.

4) [attr-5]
- Definition:
  - A story is [attr-5] if the story has the theme Humor.
- Annotator check:
  - The story’s tone, intent, or primary theme is comedic, satirical, or meant to elicit amusement.

5) [attr-2]
- Logical rule:
  - A story is [attr-2] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is not [attr-7]
- Notes for annotators:
  - This label requires all three conditions to hold simultaneously (logical AND of the three bullets).
  - Pay attention to the “not” condition: the absence of superlative forms is required.

6) [attr-3]
- Logical rule:
  - A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-6]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-2]
      - The story is [attr-7]
- Notes for annotators:
  - This label requires two things:
    1) The story must be about lost civilizations.
    2) Between [attr-2] and [attr-7], exactly one must hold (exclusive OR).
  - If neither or both of those two are true, do not assign [attr-3].

Quick logical cheat-sheet (for clarity)
- [attr-2] = [attr-4] AND [attr-5] AND NOT [attr-7]
- [attr-3] = [attr-6] AND (exactly one of ([attr-2], [attr-7]))

Annotation procedure (recommended)
- Step 1: Identify basic properties:
  - Does the story start with a noun? → mark [attr-4] if yes.
  - Is the theme humor? → mark [attr-5] if yes.
  - Does the story use superlative forms? → mark [attr-7] if yes.
  - Is it about lost civilizations? → mark [attr-6] if yes.
- Step 2: Derive composed labels:
  - Assign [attr-2] only if all three constituent conditions (including NOT) hold.
  - Assign [attr-3] only if [attr-6] holds AND exactly one of ([attr-2], [attr-7]) holds.

End note
- Do not alter node IDs or the logical relationships when applying labels.
- Follow the exact logical operators as stated (AND, NOT, Exactly one).
