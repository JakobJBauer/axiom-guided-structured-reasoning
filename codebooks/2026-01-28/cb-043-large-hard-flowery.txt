[THEME-INNOVATION]
A story is [THEME-INNOVATION] if The story has the theme Innovation
In the gentle hush of our catalog, this label is bestowed upon any narrative whose beating heart sings of invention, bright contrivances, and the audacious reshaping of the world — a theme that tastes of copper and new dawns.

[THEME-MAGIC]
A story is [THEME-MAGIC] if The story has the theme Magic
Let this marker crown tales steeped in wonder, where hidden forces whisper and improbable charms ripple through the plot like starlight through leaves.

[HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]
A story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN] if The story has Checkhov's gun
This token marks the presence of a promise kept: an object or detail introduced with deliberate gravity whose later arrival fulfills fate’s quiet contract.

[STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] if The story starts with a adverb
We listen for the first breath of the sentence: when it opens with an adverb, the tale is flagged with this subtle stylistic flourish.

[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if The story has the theme Helping Others
Bestow this upon narratives that turn their compass toward compassion, where characters reach outward and the plot is braided with acts of aid.

[STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if The story is philosophical
Use this when a story lingers in the halls of thought, weighing abstractions and asking large, patient questions of existence.

[STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
A story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] if The story starts with a noun
This label is given when the tale’s opening is anchored by a noun, a solid first step that names the world before it moves.

[TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
A story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] if The story is about hidden treasures
Attach this when the plot turns on secret hoards, buried riches, or valuables waiting beneath the soil of the narrative.

[THEME-GROWTH]
A story is [THEME-GROWTH] if The story has the theme Growth
Mark stories where unfolding, maturation, and transformation are the lodestars — the arc of becoming is central.

[HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
A story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] if The story has a cliffhanger
This badge denotes a tale that leaves breath suspended at the precipice, promising continuation with the delicious ache of uncertainty.

[STYLE-MINIMALIST]
A story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST] if The story is minimalist
Assign this to works trimmed to essential lines, where silence and sparse detail carve meaning with surgical precision.

[USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
A story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD] if The story uses conditional mood
We note when a narrative habitually dwells in “ifs” and “mights,” when contingency shapes sentences and possibilities.

[TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
A story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES] if The story is about seasonal changes
This tag embraces tales that chart the turning of seasons, using the year’s wheel as a stage for mood and moment.

[TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
A story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES] if The story is about mystical creatures
Apply this when the cast includes beings of myth, fey, or otherworldly provenance, whose very presence colors the tale with enchantment.

[HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
A story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY] if The story has a story within a story
This denotes nesting: the main narrative cradles another tale inside it, a smaller story echoing the larger.

[MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
A story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS] if The story has more than 6 paragraphs
A practical measure of length: when the text blossoms beyond six paragraphs, it earns this descriptor.

[THEME-AGENCY]
A story is [THEME-AGENCY] if The story has the theme Agency
Label stories where characters actively steer their fates, exercising choice and will that shape the journey.

[PARAGRAPH-DENSITY]
A story is [PARAGRAPH-DENSITY] if [MANY-PARAGRAPHS] equals true
A shorthand: when the tale satisfies the threshold of many paragraphs, we consider its paragraph density to be affirmed.

[STRUCTURAL-START]
A story is [STRUCTURAL-START] if both of the following are true:
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
- The story is in [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL, STYLE-MINIMALIST]
Think of this as a structural rubric: the beginning’s grammar must choose only one avenue — either an adverbial wind or a noun’s solid footfall — and the whole composition must reside in the stylistic territory of philosophical reflection or austere minimalism.

[MOTIF-MYSTERY]
A story is [MOTIF-MYSTERY] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
  - The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
  - The story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
This motif gathers tales in which the allure of secret riches and the presence of the uncanny cohabit, or where a single thread — buried treasure or the turning seasons — alone suffices to weave an air of enigma.

[MORAL-TENSION]
A story is [MORAL-TENSION] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
- both of the following are true:
  - exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [THEME-GROWTH]
    - The story is [THEME-AGENCY]
  - The story is not [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
This label captures ethical strain: it appears when altruism is central, or when the tale balances growth against agency — but only if the narrative is not pared down to minimalist austerity.

[THEMATIC-CORE]
A story is [THEMATIC-CORE] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [THEME-INNOVATION]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [MORAL-TENSION]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEME-MAGIC]
    - The story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
Here we name the heart of a complex idea: a tale driven by innovation that is also braided with moral quandary, or else infused with magic and the soft subjunctive of conditional possibility.

[NARRATIVE-DEVICES]
A story is [NARRATIVE-DEVICES] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]
  - The story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
  - The story is not [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]
This category gathers tales employing striking structural tools: echoes of promise or the breath-held cliff, together with nesting tales or the absence of a previously mentioned device, composing a tapestry of narrative technique.

[COMPLEX-STORY-TYPE]
A story is [COMPLEX-STORY-TYPE] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [THEMATIC-CORE]
- either of the following is true:
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [STRUCTURAL-START]
    - either of the following is true:
      - both of the following are true:
        - The story is [NARRATIVE-DEVICES]
        - The story is [PARAGRAPH-DENSITY]
      - The story is [MOTIF-MYSTERY]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [NARRATIVE-DEVICES]
    - The story is not [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
This final, ornate classification crowns those narratives that dwell at the intersection of inventive core themes and layered form: innovation married to moral or magical depth, then woven through with a particular opening structure plus either dense paragraphs and narrative flourishes or a motif of mystery — or else granted narrative devices without the lean austerity of minimalism. It is the label for stories whose complexity reads like a rich tapestry, every thread intentionally placed.
