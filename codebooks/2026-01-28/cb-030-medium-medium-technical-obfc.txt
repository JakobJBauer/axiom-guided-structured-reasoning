Codebook — Formal Definitions for Story Annotation

This document specifies the atomic and compound annotation labels used for classifying short stories. Each label is defined as a predicate that evaluates to true for a given story when the stated conditions are satisfied. Logical compositions preserve the original Boolean structure (AND, OR, NOT, exclusive OR). Node identifiers are preserved exactly as given.

Atomic predicates

- [attr-9]
  - Definition: The predicate [attr-9] is true if and only if the story employs the conditional mood in its verbal morphology or modal construction (e.g., “would,” conditional verb forms).

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: The predicate [attr-6] is true if and only if the first lexical token of the story is an adverb.

- [attr-8]
  - Definition: The predicate [attr-8] is true if and only if the story contains the thematic element of agency (e.g., emphasis on volition, intentional action, autonomy).

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: The predicate [attr-5] is true if and only if the story contains fewer than 160 words.

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: The predicate [attr-7] is true if and only if the story’s tone is lighthearted.

- [attr-10]
  - Definition: The predicate [attr-10] is true if and only if the story employs perfect aspect constructions (e.g., “has eaten,” “had gone”).

Compound predicates (logical compositions)

- [attr-3]
  - Logical specification: [attr-3] is true iff both of the following hold:
    - The story is [attr-9]
    - The story is not [attr-10]
  - Formal: [attr-3] = [attr-9] AND (NOT [attr-10])

- [attr-4]
  - Logical specification: [attr-4] is true iff both of the following hold:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is [attr-7]
  - Formal: [attr-4] = [attr-5] AND [attr-7]

- [attr-1]
  - Logical specification: [attr-1] is true iff both of the following hold:
    - The story is [attr-8]
    - Exactly one of the following is true (exclusive OR):
      - The story is [attr-6]
      - The story is [attr-5]
  - Formal: [attr-1] = [attr-8] AND XOR([attr-6], [attr-5])

- [attr-2]
  - Logical specification: [attr-2] is true iff both of the following hold:
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - At least one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-3]
      - The story is [attr-1]
  - Formal: [attr-2] = [attr-4] AND ([attr-3] OR [attr-1])

Notes on interpretation
- “Both of the following are true” specifies a logical AND of the enumerated conditions.
- “Exactly one of the following is true” specifies an exclusive OR (XOR): precisely one operand must be true.
- “Either/At least one of the following are true” specifies an inclusive OR: one or more operands may be true.
- Atomic predicates are evaluated with reference to the story text and linguistic/semantic criteria as defined above.

Use these definitions as authoritative for annotation and automated rule-based reasoning.
