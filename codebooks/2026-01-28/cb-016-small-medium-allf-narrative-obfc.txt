[attr-5]
There are stories that wear their compassion like a banner — tales where the characters turn toward others and the narrative is swept along by generosity. 
A story is [attr-5] if
The story has the theme Helping Others.

[attr-2]
Imagine the protagonist stepping into the scene with hands ready to fix what’s broken or a heart open to give. That central deed — the pivot of the plot — tells you whether the tale is built around active help.
A story is [attr-2] if either of the following is true:
- The protagonist's central action is in the set {aid, rescue}
- The protagonist's central action is in the set {donate, teach}

[attr-3]
Sometimes a helpful gesture is a mask for something else — the glint of self-interest behind a smile.
A story is [attr-3] if
- The protagonist's motive is equal to "personal gain"

[attr-4]
Now picture an arc that shines because the lead chooses to help for the sake of others, not for a reward. That arc needs two things to hold true together: the act of help, and the absence of selfish motive.
A story is [attr-4] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-2]
- The story is not [attr-3]

[attr-1]
Finally, there are moments that feel altruistic — but that feeling can come from one of two sources, and only one may be present at a time for the label to fit. The story is marked as [attr-1] when exactly one of these guiding lights shines.
A story is [attr-1] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-4]
