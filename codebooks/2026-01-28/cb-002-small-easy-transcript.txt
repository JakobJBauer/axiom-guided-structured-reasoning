Interviewer: Let's go through this codebook together. First off, what does [STYLE-PLAYFUL] mean?

Expert: Simple. A story is [STYLE-PLAYFUL] if the story is playful.

Interviewer: And [STYLE-MODERN]?

Expert: A story is [STYLE-MODERN] if the story is modern.

Interviewer: How about [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] — what does that label capture?

Expert: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] if the story starts with a adjective.

Interviewer: There's also [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]. What's the criterion there?

Expert: A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if the story uses discourse markers.

Interviewer: I see a node called [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]. What does that encode?

Expert: A story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN] if the story has Checkhov's gun.

Interviewer: Now the codebook defines some compound nodes. Tell me about [MODERN-OPENING].

Expert: Sure. A story is [MODERN-OPENING] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [STYLE-MODERN]
- The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]

Interviewer: So to mark [MODERN-OPENING], both conditions must hold — it's an AND, right?

Expert: Correct. Both must be true for [MODERN-OPENING] to apply.

Interviewer: And finally, what's the rule for [ENGAGING-STRUCTURE]?

Expert: A story is [ENGAGING-STRUCTURE] if both of the following are true:
- The story is either [STYLE-PLAYFUL] or [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
- The story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]

Interviewer: Let me restate that to be clear: [ENGAGING-STRUCTURE] requires two things — first, the story must satisfy at least one of [STYLE-PLAYFUL] or [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] (an OR), and second, it must satisfy [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]. Is that accurate?

Expert: Exactly. The first bullet is an either/or condition; the second is required as well. Both bullets together must be true for [ENGAGING-STRUCTURE].

Interviewer: Thanks — that keeps the logical relationships precise and easy to follow. Anything else I should note while annotating?

Expert: Just remember: all node IDs—like [STYLE-PLAYFUL], [MODERN-OPENING], [ENGAGING-STRUCTURE]—are the anchors. Apply the simple definitions for the atomic nodes, and then use the compound rules exactly as stated: "both of the following are true" indicates conjunction, and "either ... or" indicates disjunction in the listed compound nodes.
