Overview
- Purpose: Provide a clear, structured reference for each annotation label (node).  
- Format: Each entry states the condition(s) under which a story is considered to have that label. Composite labels explicitly list the logical operations (And / Or / Not / Exactly one) that combine simpler labels.  
- Note: All node IDs are preserved exactly as written (in [BRACKET] format). Logical relationships and formulas are unchanged.

Atomic labels (base conditions)
- [THEME-AGENCY]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-AGENCY] if the story has the theme Agency.

- [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] if the story starts with a noun.

- [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES] if the story is about giant creatures.

- [THEME-KINDNESS]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-KINDNESS] if the story has the theme Kindness.

- [HIGH-READABILITY]
  - Definition: A story is [HIGH-READABILITY] if the story has readability score above 96.1.

- [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES] if the story is about mystical creatures.

Composite labels (built from atomic labels)
- [MYSTICAL-GIANTS]
  - Rule: A story is [MYSTICAL-GIANTS] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
    - The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]

- [SOLVER-OR-AGENCY]
  - Rule: A story is [SOLVER-OR-AGENCY] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
    - The story is [THEME-AGENCY]

- [ALTRUISM-SOLVER]
  - Rule: A story is [ALTRUISM-SOLVER] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
    - The story is [SOLVER-OR-AGENCY]

- [OPENING-ASSERTIVE]
  - Rule: A story is [OPENING-ASSERTIVE] if both of the following are true:
    - [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] equals true
    - The story is not [THEME-AGENCY]

Featured label (complex nested condition)
- [FEATURED-STORY]
  - Rule: A story is [FEATURED-STORY] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [MYSTICAL-GIANTS]
    - either of the following is true:
      - Branch A — both conditions must hold:
        - The story is [ALTRUISM-SOLVER]
        - [HIGH-READABILITY] equals true
      - Branch B — both conditions must hold:
        - The story is [OPENING-ASSERTIVE]
        - [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES] is in [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES, TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]

Usage guidance (how to read these rules)
- “Both of the following are true” indicates a logical AND: every listed sub-condition must hold.
- “Exactly one of the following is true” indicates exclusive OR: choose one and only one sub-condition must hold.
- “Either of the following is true” indicates logical OR: at least one of the branches must hold; each branch may itself require multiple conditions (AND).
- When a condition uses phrasing like “[LABEL] equals true” or “is not [LABEL],” apply the label’s truth as the boolean check.

End note
- This structured layout preserves the original logical relationships and node IDs. Use it as a checklist when annotating: evaluate atomic labels first, then apply composite rules in the order shown.
