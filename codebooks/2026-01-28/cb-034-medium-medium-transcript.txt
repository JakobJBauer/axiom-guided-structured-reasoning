Interviewer: Let's go through this codebook like a conversation. I'll ask about a label, and you'll explain exactly what it means. Ready?

Respondent: Ready. Ask away.

Interviewer: What does [THEME-GROWTH] mean?

Respondent: A story is [THEME-GROWTH] if the story has the theme Growth.

Interviewer: And [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]?

Respondent: A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if the story has the theme Helping Others.

Interviewer: How about [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]?

Respondent: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] if the story starts with an adverb.

Interviewer: [STYLE-MODERN] — what's the rule?

Respondent: A story is [STYLE-MODERN] if the story is modern.

Interviewer: What does [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES] indicate?

Respondent: A story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES] if the story is about seasonal changes.

Interviewer: [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]?

Respondent: A story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] if the story uses perfect aspect.

Interviewer: How is [LOW-READABILITY] defined?

Respondent: A story is [LOW-READABILITY] if the story has readability score below 86.4.

Interviewer: And [STYLE-CLASSIC]?

Respondent: A story is [STYLE-CLASSIC] if the story is classic.

Interviewer: What about [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]?

Respondent: A story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES] if the story is about mystical creatures.

Interviewer: [HIGH-READABILITY]?

Respondent: A story is [HIGH-READABILITY] if the story has readability score above 96.1.

Interviewer: Now the composite labels. Explain [SEASONAL-GROWTH].

Respondent: Sure. A story is [SEASONAL-GROWTH] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
- The story is [THEME-GROWTH]
- The story is not [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]

Interviewer: So it needs both the seasonal topic and a growth theme, and it must exclude mystical creatures — understood. Now the big one: [COMPOSED-STORY]. Walk me through that.

Respondent: Absolutely. A story is [COMPOSED-STORY] if either of the following is true:

1) Both of these are true:
   - The story is [SEASONAL-GROWTH]
   - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]

OR

2) Either of the following is true:
   a) Both of these are true:
      - The story is [STYLE-MODERN]
      - The story is not [LOW-READABILITY]
   b) Both of these are true:
      - The story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]
      - Both of the following are true:
         - The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
         - The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]

Interviewer: To confirm: there are two main routes to [COMPOSED-STORY]. One is seasonal-growth combined with helping-others. The other route splits into a modern, not-low-readability option, or a classic option that requires perfect aspect and high readability.

Respondent: Exactly. The logical structure — the ANDs, ORs, NOTs and the nesting — is preserved as stated.

Interviewer: Great. Anything else to highlight for someone using this for annotation?

Respondent: Just this: when you apply these labels, follow the exact conditions as we've spoken. Pay attention to the negations (for example, "not [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]" and "not [LOW-READABILITY]") and to the nested grouping — those determine which combination of labels qualifies a story for a composite tag like [SEASONAL-GROWTH] or [COMPOSED-STORY].

Interviewer: Perfect. That makes the logic clear and keeps the original structure intact. Thank you.
