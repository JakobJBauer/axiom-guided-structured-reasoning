Structured Codebook (preserving all node IDs and logical relations)

Overview
- This document restates each node and its exact logical conditions in a clear, hierarchical layout.
- Atomic predicates are listed first (simple labels about a story). Composite predicates follow, using the same logical operators as the original: both of the following are true, either of the following is true, exactly one of the following is true, The story is not [NODE], and equality checks (equals true).
- All node IDs are unchanged and all logical relationships and operations are preserved exactly.

Notes for annotators (guidance only; does not change logic)
- Read each node as a precise label: "A story is [NODE] if <conditions>".
- Follow the exact logical operators shown (both / either / exactly one / not). The nesting matters—conditions under a given bullet belong to that operator.
- Use atomic labels (Section A) to evaluate composite nodes (Section C). Do not infer extra relationships beyond what is written here.
