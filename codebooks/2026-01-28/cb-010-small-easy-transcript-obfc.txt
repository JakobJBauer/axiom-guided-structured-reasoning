Interviewer: Let's go through this codebook together. First, what does [attr-4] mean?

Expert: A story is [attr-4] if the story has the theme Innovation.

Interviewer: Got it. And what about [attr-6]?

Expert: A story is [attr-6] if the story is about cultural traditions.

Interviewer: How about [attr-5]?

Expert: A story is [attr-5] if the story is about bygone eras.

Interviewer: I see. There's also [attr-7] — what does that denote?

Expert: A story is [attr-7] if the story uses wh-questions.

Interviewer: And these start-with tags — what do they indicate?

Expert: A story is [attr-2] if the story starts with a noun.
A story is [attr-3] if the story starts with a preposition.

Interviewer: Now the important composite node — tell me how [attr-1] is defined.

Expert: Sure. Here's the exact logical definition you should use:

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-4]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-6]
  - The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-7]

Interviewer: So to confirm, a story must have the Innovation theme, must be either about cultural traditions or bygone eras, and must use wh-questions — all three together — to be marked as [attr-1]?

Expert: Exactly. All those conditions together form the label [attr-1].
