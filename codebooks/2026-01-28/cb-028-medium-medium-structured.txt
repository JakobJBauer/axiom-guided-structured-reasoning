Codebook — structured reference

Purpose: Provide a clear, hierarchical description of each annotation node and the exact logical conditions that determine when a story satisfies that node. All node IDs, logical operators, and relationships are preserved exactly as in the original codebook.

1) Atomic (base) properties
- [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON] if the story has a moral lesson.
- [MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
  - Definition: A story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS] if the story has more than 6 paragraphs.
- [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] if the story starts with a adverb.
- [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] if the story has circular narrative structure.
- [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
  - Definition: A story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] if the story uses perfect aspect.
- [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
  - Definition: A story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS] if the story uses superlative forms.

2) Derived (composite) nodes — logical structure and conditions
- [STYLISTIC-CHOICE]
  - Summary: Requires that the story starts with an adverb AND exactly one of two stylistic markers holds.
  - Formal conditions:
    - A story is [STYLISTIC-CHOICE] if both of the following are true:
      - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
      - Exactly one of the following is true:
        - The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
        - The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]

- [NARRATIVE-TYPE]
  - Summary: True when the story either has a circular narrative, or — if it does not have a circular structure — it has many paragraphs.
  - Formal conditions:
    - A story is [NARRATIVE-TYPE] if either of the following is true:
      - The story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is not [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
        - The story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS]

- [MORAL-OR-LONG]
  - Summary: True when exactly one of the two length/moral properties holds: either a moral lesson or many paragraphs, but not both.
  - Formal conditions:
    - A story is [MORAL-OR-LONG] if exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
      - The story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS]

- [COMPLEXITY-HIGH]
  - Summary: Indicates a high complexity story when it meets narrative-type requirements, and additionally either shows a specific stylistic choice or does not satisfy MORAL-OR-LONG.
  - Formal conditions:
    - A story is [COMPLEXITY-HIGH] if both of the following are true:
      - Either of the following is true:
        - The story is [STYLISTIC-CHOICE]
        - The story is not [MORAL-OR-LONG]
      - The story is [NARRATIVE-TYPE]

3) Quick logical maps (for reference)
- [STYLISTIC-CHOICE] = [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] AND exactly-one([USES-PERFECT-ASPECT], [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS])
- [NARRATIVE-TYPE] = [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] OR (NOT [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] AND [MANY-PARAGRAPHS])
- [MORAL-OR-LONG] = exactly-one([HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON], [MANY-PARAGRAPHS])
- [COMPLEXITY-HIGH] = [NARRATIVE-TYPE] AND ( [STYLISTIC-CHOICE] OR NOT [MORAL-OR-LONG] )

Usage notes (annotator guidance)
- Evaluate atomic properties first (Section 1). These are the inputs used by the composite rules.
- Apply composite rules exactly as written—observe "both", "either", and "exactly one" carefully.
- The logical structure is intentional: do not simplify or alter the relationships when reasoning or implementing these conditions.
