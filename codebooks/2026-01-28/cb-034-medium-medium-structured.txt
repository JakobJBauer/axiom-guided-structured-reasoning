  - The story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
  - The story is [THEME-GROWTH]
  - The story is not [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]

    - both of the following are true:
      - The story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]
      - both of the following are true:
        - The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
        - The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]

Notes for annotators (kept concise)
- All node IDs must be used exactly as shown (including brackets).
- Logical words such as "all of the following", "both of the following", "either of the following", and "not" indicate precise boolean relationships — follow them literally.
- This structured layout mirrors the original logic while making it easier to check conditions step by step.
