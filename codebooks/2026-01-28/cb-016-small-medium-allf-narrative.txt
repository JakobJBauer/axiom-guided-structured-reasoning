[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
There are stories that wear their compassion like a banner — tales where the characters turn toward others and the narrative is swept along by generosity. 
A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if
The story has the theme Helping Others.

[HELPFUL-ACTION]
Imagine the protagonist stepping into the scene with hands ready to fix what’s broken or a heart open to give. That central deed — the pivot of the plot — tells you whether the tale is built around active help.
A story is [HELPFUL-ACTION] if either of the following is true:
- The protagonist's central action is in the set {aid, rescue}
- The protagonist's central action is in the set {donate, teach}

[MOTIVE-SELFISH]
Sometimes a helpful gesture is a mask for something else — the glint of self-interest behind a smile.
A story is [MOTIVE-SELFISH] if
- The protagonist's motive is equal to "personal gain"

[SELFLESS-ARC]
Now picture an arc that shines because the lead chooses to help for the sake of others, not for a reward. That arc needs two things to hold true together: the act of help, and the absence of selfish motive.
A story is [SELFLESS-ARC] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [HELPFUL-ACTION]
- The story is not [MOTIVE-SELFISH]

[ALTRUISTIC-HELP]
Finally, there are moments that feel altruistic — but that feeling can come from one of two sources, and only one may be present at a time for the label to fit. The story is marked as [ALTRUISTIC-HELP] when exactly one of these guiding lights shines.
A story is [ALTRUISTIC-HELP] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
- The story is [SELFLESS-ARC]
