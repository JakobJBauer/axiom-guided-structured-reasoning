Think of this as a friendly cheat-sheet for tagging stories — relaxed in tone but strict in logic. Each entry tells you when to apply a tag; the node IDs in brackets are the exact labels you'll use.

[MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
Call a story [MANY-PARAGRAPHS] when it stretches beyond six paragraphs.

[STYLE-CLASSIC]
Tag a story [STYLE-CLASSIC] when its overall style fits the classic mold.

[HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
Use [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] for a story that leaves you hanging with a cliffhanger.

[STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
Mark a story [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if the very first word is a preposition.

[THEME-DECEPTION]
Apply [THEME-DECEPTION] when the story carries the theme of deception.

[STYLE-PLAYFUL]
A story is [STYLE-PLAYFUL] when its tone or approach feels playful.

[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
Use [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if the story’s theme centers on helping others.

[THEME-AGENCY]
Tag [THEME-AGENCY] when the story foregrounds agency — characters acting with control or power.

[HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
Mark [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] when the story uses juxtaposition.

[STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
Use [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] for stories that take on a philosophical tone.

[RICH-THEME]
A story is [RICH-THEME] if either of the following is true:
- The story is both [THEME-DECEPTION] and not [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEME-AGENCY]
  - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]

In other words: a rich theme can come from deception that isn’t about helping others, or from a situation where exactly one of agency or helping-others is present — but not both.

[COMPLEX-CLASSIC-ARC]
A story is [COMPLEX-CLASSIC-ARC] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is both [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] and not [STYLE-PLAYFUL]
  - The story is both [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] and [RICH-THEME]

So, to earn the [COMPLEX-CLASSIC-ARC] label it must be classic in style, and then either end on a non-playful cliffhanger, or begin with a preposition and qualify as a [RICH-THEME].
