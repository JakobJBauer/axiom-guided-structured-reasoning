Imagine an old curator in a great library of tales, walking the aisles and whispering rules into the spine of every story. Each rule is a little lantern that lights what a tale truly is. Below, the curator speaks plainly — part poetry, part law — but never changes the lanterns themselves. Each bracketed name is one of those lanterns, and each rule that follows is exact: the way the curator ties a lantern to a story.

[THEME-AGENCY]
The curator taps a lantern labeled [THEME-AGENCY] when a tale pulses with characters choosing, acting, and shaping their fate. The rule is simple and exact:
A story is [THEME-AGENCY] if The story has the theme Agency

[STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
Some tales begin with a single sturdy word that sets the scene — a noun that stands at the gate. The curator notes such openings with this lantern:
A story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] if The story starts with a noun

[TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
When a story’s horizon is filled with enormous forms — beasts and behemoths that dwarf the ordinary — the giant-creature lantern is lit:
A story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES] if The story is about giant creatures

[THEME-KINDNESS]
There are tales that breathe gentleness, gestures of care and generosity. For those, the kindness lantern glows:
A story is [THEME-KINDNESS] if The story has the theme Kindness

[HIGH-READABILITY]
Some stories are so clear and smooth to read they practically sing; the curator marks the clearest with a numerical standard:
A story is [HIGH-READABILITY] if The story has readability score above 96.1

[TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
Other stories carry a shimmer — creatures of mystery, spirits and beings of otherness. Those tales receive their own lantern:
A story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES] if The story is about mystical creatures

[THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
Some narratives are puzzles and journeys of cunning, where minds untangle knots and repair wrongs. The curator assigns them this mark:
A story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] if The story has the theme Problem-Solving

[MYSTICAL-GIANTS]
Sometimes two lanterns merge into a single, rarer light: giant creatures that are also mystical. For that special fusion, the curator requires both conditions at once:
A story is [MYSTICAL-GIANTS] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
- The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]

[SOLVER-OR-AGENCY]
There are tales that wear either a problem-solver’s hat or an agent’s cloak — but not both. The curator insists on exclusivity for this marker:
A story is [SOLVER-OR-AGENCY] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
- The story is [THEME-AGENCY]

[ALTRUISM-SOLVER]
When a story combines a gentle heart with the single-mindedness of a solver-or-agent — kindness plus that exclusive quality — the curator crowns it with a special name:
A story is [ALTRUISM-SOLVER] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
- The story is [SOLVER-OR-AGENCY]

[OPENING-ASSERTIVE]
Some tales begin boldly and not with a character-driven mandate of agency. If a story opens with a noun and does not carry agency as its theme, it earns an assertive opening mark:
A story is [OPENING-ASSERTIVE] if both of the following are true:
- [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] equals true
- The story is not [THEME-AGENCY]

[FEATURED-STORY]
Finally, the curator’s most prized banner — the [FEATURED-STORY] — is reserved for narratives that sparkle in a very particular constellation. A tale must first be one of the mystical giants; then it must satisfy one of two precise pathways. The rules read like strict lore:
A story is [FEATURED-STORY] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [MYSTICAL-GIANTS]
- either of the following is true:
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [ALTRUISM-SOLVER]
    - [HIGH-READABILITY] equals true
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [OPENING-ASSERTIVE]
    - [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES] is in [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES, TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]

So the curator walks on, lanterns clinking softly: each bracketed name exact, each condition preserved, each junction of logic untouched — a storytelling map that is both precise and, if you listen, quietly magical.
