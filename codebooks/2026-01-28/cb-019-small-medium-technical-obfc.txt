Codebook — Formal annotation specifications

Purpose: Precise definitions for story-level annotation nodes. Each node below specifies the criterion required to assign the corresponding label to a story. Logical operators used: Not (logical negation), And (conjunction / all must hold), Or (inclusive disjunction), and "Exactly one" (exclusive disjunction / XOR). Node identifiers are preserved verbatim in [attr-1] format.

Atomic labels (single-condition predicates)

[attr-7]
Definition: A story is annotated with [attr-7] if the narrative text employs superlative grammatical forms (e.g., "best", "most", "largest") in its expression.

[attr-6]
Definition: A story is annotated with [attr-6] if the subject matter of the story concerns lost, extinct, or otherwise historically vanished civilizations.

[attr-4]
Definition: A story is annotated with [attr-4] if the first token of the story is a noun (lexical category: noun).

[attr-5]
Definition: A story is annotated with [attr-5] if the principal theme of the narrative is humor (the story is intended to be humorous or comedic in tone).

Composite labels (logical combinations)

[attr-2]
Specification: Assign [attr-2] when all of the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied:
- The story is [attr-4] (conjunction).
- The story is [attr-5] (conjunction).
- The story is not [attr-7] (logical negation: the story must not satisfy [attr-7]).

Formal interpretation: [attr-2] = [attr-4] AND [attr-5] AND NOT [attr-7].

[attr-3]
Specification: Assign [attr-3] when both of the following hold:
- The story is [attr-6].
- Exactly one of the following is true (exclusive disjunction):
  - The story is [attr-2].
  - The story is [attr-7].

Formal interpretation: [attr-3] = [attr-6] AND ( [attr-2] XOR [attr-7] ).

Notes on application
- These definitions are intended as deterministic annotation rules: labels should be applied only when the specified logical condition is satisfied.
- "Exactly one" denotes exclusive OR: if both subconditions are true or both false, the exclusive condition fails.
- The composite-node formal interpretations above preserve the original logical structure and operators; do not alter the underlying relationships when applying labels.
