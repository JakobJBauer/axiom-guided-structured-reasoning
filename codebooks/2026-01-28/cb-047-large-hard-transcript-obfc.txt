Interviewer: Let's walk through this codebook like a conversation. I'll ask about each label and you explain what it means. Ready?

Expert: Ready. Ask away.

Interviewer: First, what does [attr-7] mean?

Expert: [attr-7] — It means: A story is HIGH-READABILITY if the story has readability score above 96.1.

Interviewer: And [attr-8]?

Expert: [attr-8] — A story is LOW-READABILITY if the story has readability score below 86.4.

Interviewer: Simple enough. What about sentence-start properties, like [attr-14] and [attr-13]?

Expert: 
- [attr-14] — A story is STARTS-WITH-NOUN if the story starts with a noun.
- [attr-13] — A story is STARTS-WITH-ADVERB if the story starts with an adverb.

Interviewer: How about aspect and markers — [attr-21] and [attr-20]?

Expert: 
- [attr-21] — A story is USES-PERFECT-ASPECT if the story uses perfect aspect.
- [attr-20] — A story is USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS if the story uses discourse markers.

Interviewer: There are a few content/plot tags: [attr-4], [attr-6], [attr-5]. Explain those.

Expert:
- [attr-4] — A story is HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER if the story has a cliffhanger.
- [attr-6] — A story is HAS-JUXTAPOSITION if the story has juxtaposition.
- [attr-5] — A story is HAS-A-RED-HERRING if the story has a Red Herring.

Interviewer: What counts as [attr-12]?

Expert: [attr-12] — A story is SHORT-STORY if the story has fewer than 160 words.

Interviewer: And the style tags — [attr-16], [attr-17], [attr-15]?

Expert:
- [attr-16] — A story is STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL if the story is philosophical.
- [attr-17] — A story is STYLE-PLAYFUL if the story is playful.
- [attr-15] — A story is STYLE-HUMOROUS if the story is humorous.

Interviewer: There's a theme tag too: [attr-19].

Expert: [attr-19] — A story is THEME-AGENCY if the story has the theme Agency.

Interviewer: Now we reach composed labels. Start with [attr-10]. How is that defined?

Expert: [attr-10] — A story is OPENING-TONE if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-14]
  - The story is [attr-13]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-16]
  - The story is [attr-17]

Interviewer: So OPENING-TONE requires one of the start types and one of those styles. Got it. Next: [attr-9].

Expert: [attr-9] — A story is NARRATIVE-PACE if either of the following is true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-12]
  - The story is [attr-7]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-21]
  - The story is not [attr-8]

Interviewer: That gives two alternate routes to NARRATIVE-PACE. What about [attr-2]?

Expert: [attr-2] — A story is COMEDIC-STRUCTURE if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-17]
  - The story is [attr-15]
- Both of the following are true:
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-12]
    - The story is [attr-20]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is [attr-6]

Interviewer: That second bullet is a bit nested. So COMEDIC-STRUCTURE needs playful or humorous style, and then two conditions: an exclusive choice between short story or discourse markers, plus either a red herring or juxtaposition.

Expert: Exactly — the logical relationships are preserved: "Either" at the top, and then "Both" with an "Exactly one" and another "Either."

Interviewer: Now [attr-18], please.

Expert: [attr-18] — A story is THEMATIC-FUSION if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-19]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-16]
    - The story is [attr-10]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-6]
    - The story is [attr-5]

Interviewer: So THEMATIC-FUSION needs the Agency theme, plus either a philosophical style combined with OPENING-TONE, or exactly one of juxtaposition/red-herring.

Expert: Correct.

Interviewer: [attr-11] is next. How is that structured?

Expert: [attr-11] — A story is RAPTURE-ENDING if either of the following is true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is not [attr-12]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is [attr-5]

Interviewer: So RAPTURE-ENDING can be satisfied by a non-short cliffhanger, or by an exclusive choice between cliffhanger and red herring.

Expert: Yes — keep in mind the "not [attr-12]" and the "exactly one" constraint.

Interviewer: Finally, the big one: [attr-3].

Expert: [attr-3] — A story is COMPLEX-STORY if both of the following are true:
- All of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-18]
  - The story is [attr-2]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-9]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-11]
    - The story is not [attr-7]

Interviewer: So to be COMPLEX-STORY you must satisfy THEMATIC-FUSION and COMEDIC-STRUCTURE together, and then either have NARRATIVE-PACE or have a RAPTURE-ENDING while not being HIGH-READABILITY.

Expert: Exactly. The nesting and logical operators — All, Both, Either, Exactly one, and negations — are preserved precisely. Nothing added, nothing removed; just explained in dialogue.

Interviewer: Great. One last check — did we change any node IDs, any logical operators, or omit nodes?

Expert: No changes. All node IDs are preserved in [attr-1] format, every logical relationship (Not, And, Or, Exactly one, Both, All, Either) is kept intact, and no nodes were added or removed.

Interviewer: Perfect. That should make this codebook easier to read while keeping its logic intact. Thanks.
