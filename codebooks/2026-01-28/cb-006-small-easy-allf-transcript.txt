Interviewer: Let's walk through this codebook together. Can you start with the simplest entries?

Expert: Sure. I'll read the formal line and then explain it in plain terms.

Expert: [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
- Formal: A story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] if The story has a flashback
- Explanation: That one is straightforward — if the story contains a flashback, you mark it as [HAS-A-FLASHBACK].

Interviewer: And the next two?

Expert: Yes.

Expert: [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
- Formal: A story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] if The story uses wh-questions
- Explanation: Mark [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] when the narrative includes wh-questions (who, what, where, when, why, how).

Expert: [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
- Formal: A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if The story uses discourse markers
- Explanation: Use [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] when the story employs discourse markers — words or phrases that organize or connect the flow of the text (for example transitions, signpost words, and similar devices).

Interviewer: Now the codebook defines [INTERACTIVE]. How should we read that?

Expert: Read exactly as written, then I'll unpack it.

Expert: [INTERACTIVE]
- Formal: A story is [INTERACTIVE] if exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
  - The story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
- Explanation: This says [INTERACTIVE] holds when exactly one of those two conditions is true — that is, the story either uses wh-questions or uses discourse markers, but not both. (The phrase "exactly one" enforces that exclusivity.)

Interviewer: Got it. How about [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]?

Expert: Again, here's the formal definition first.

Expert: [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]
- Formal: A story is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] if both of the following are true:
  - The story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
  - The story is not [INTERACTIVE]
- Explanation: So to classify a story as [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE], two things must hold at the same time: it must have a flashback, and it must not satisfy the [INTERACTIVE] condition. In other words, a flashback plus the absence of that exclusive-interaction pattern equals [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE].

Interviewer: And the last node, [SPECIAL-CASE]?

Expert: Yes — here's the formal entry and then a plain-language reading.

Expert: [SPECIAL-CASE]
- Formal: A story is [SPECIAL-CASE] if either of the following is true:
  - The story is in the set { [INTERACTIVE], [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] }
  - The story is equal to [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
- Explanation: This declares that a story is a [SPECIAL-CASE] if at least one of these holds: it belongs to the set containing [INTERACTIVE] or [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE], or it is exactly [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]. Practically, that means any story that is interactive or complex-narrative qualifies, and any story that is simply marked [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] also qualifies. (The formal bullets are preserved verbatim to keep the logic explicit.)

Interviewer: To be clear — you preserved all the exact relationships and logical words like "exactly one," "both," "not," and "either," right?

Expert: Absolutely. The node IDs are unchanged ([HAS-A-FLASHBACK], [USES-WH-QUESTIONS], [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS], [INTERACTIVE], [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE], [SPECIAL-CASE]), and the logical structure is preserved exactly as written:
- [INTERACTIVE] uses "exactly one" between [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] and [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS].
- [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] requires both [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] and "The story is not [INTERACTIVE]".
- [SPECIAL-CASE] uses "either of the following is true" with one bullet being the set { [INTERACTIVE], [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] } and the other being equality with [HAS-A-FLASHBACK].

Interviewer: Any practical tips for annotators using this codebook?

Expert: Yes — when you mark stories:
- First note whether there's a flashback: that determines [HAS-A-FLASHBACK].
- Then check for wh-questions and discourse markers. Use the "exactly one" rule to decide [INTERACTIVE].
- Apply the "both" plus "not" rule for [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE].
- Finally, use the two bullets under [SPECIAL-CASE] — membership in { [INTERACTIVE], [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] } or equality to [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] — to decide [SPECIAL-CASE].

Interviewer: Thanks — that keeps the logical flow clear while making the rules easy to follow.

Expert: You're welcome. The formal statements are preserved verbatim in each node; the Q&A just aims to make them easier to apply in practice.
