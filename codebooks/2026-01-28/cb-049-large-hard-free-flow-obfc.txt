Here’s the same codebook, rewritten to read like a friendly guide rather than a dry list — but don’t worry: every single node ID, logical test, and relationship stays exactly as it was. I’ve kept the logical connectors (either / both / exactly one / not) intact so you can use this for annotation and reasoning without ambiguity.

[attr-3]
We mark a story [attr-3] when it contains a cliffhanger — plain and simple: the story has a cliffhanger.

[attr-18]
Use the label [attr-18] when the story feels modern. If the story is modern, it gets [attr-18].

[attr-25]
A story earns [attr-25] if it uses discourse markers — those little words and phrases that stitch sentences and thoughts together.

[attr-4]
Tag a story [attr-4] when it includes a flashback. If it has a flashback, it is [attr-4].

[attr-24]
If the story’s theme centers on problem-solving, then it’s [attr-24]. That’s the criterion.

[attr-12]
When the very beginning of the story opens with an adjective, label it [attr-12]. In short: the story starts with an adjective → [attr-12].

[attr-26]
If the story uses wh-questions (who, what, where, when, why, how), it qualifies as [attr-26].

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if it contains juxtaposition — contrasting elements placed side by side.

[attr-13]
If the story opens with an adverb, it should be tagged [attr-13].

[attr-23]
When humor is a central theme, the story is [attr-23].

[attr-7]
We call a story [attr-7] when its readability score falls below 86.4.

[attr-15]
If the story’s style is humorous, tag it [attr-15].

[attr-17]
Label a story [attr-17] when it follows a minimalist style.

[attr-16]
A story is [attr-16] when its tone is lighthearted.

[attr-6]
If the story’s readability score is above 96.1, it’s [attr-6].

[attr-22]
Tag [attr-22] when deception is a theme of the story.

[attr-19]
If the story’s style is philosophical, use [attr-19].

[attr-14]
A story is [attr-14] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-3]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is [attr-5]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-25]
  - The story is not [attr-3]

Think of [attr-14] as a catch-all for certain structural tricks: a cliffhanger qualifies outright; alternatively, a single occurrence of flashback or juxtaposition qualifies; and if discourse markers are present but there’s no cliffhanger, that combination also counts.

[attr-8]
A story is [attr-8] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-12]
  - The story is [attr-13]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-26]
  - The story is [attr-25]

So for an [attr-8] you need an opening word that’s an adjective or adverb, and then exactly one of two conversational choices in the opening: wh-questions or discourse markers — but not both.

[attr-20]
A story is [attr-20] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - The story is not [attr-17]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-15]
  - The story is not [attr-19]

In other words, [attr-20] captures two modes: a modern, lighthearted story that isn’t minimalist, or a humorous story that isn’t philosophical.

[attr-21]
A story is [attr-21] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-24]
  - The story is [attr-23]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-22]
  - The story is [attr-24]

So [attr-21] is either the combination of problem-solving plus humor, or exactly one of deception vs. problem-solving — but not both.

[attr-10]
A story is [attr-10] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- The story is [attr-6]

Pick one: low or high readability — exactly one must hold for [attr-10].

[attr-11]
A story is [attr-11] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-10]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-16]
  - The story is not [attr-7]

So [attr-11] needs the story to be classified into a readability class, and then either it’s lighthearted or it simply isn’t low readability.

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-14]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-8]
    - The story is not [attr-3]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-20]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-21]
    - The story is not [attr-19]

Picture [attr-2] as the intersection of structure/opening choices and tone/themes: structurally interesting or a specific opening pattern (without a cliffhanger), combined with either the right style tone or a thematic core that isn’t philosophical.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-11]
  - The story is [attr-20]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-15]
  - The story is [attr-17]

[attr-1] signals a story that’s suitable for audiences either because it pairs readability impact with the right tone or because it’s uniquely one of humorous or minimalist in style (but not both).

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-2]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-1]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-21]
    - The story is not [attr-10]

Finally, [attr-9] is the sweet spot: the story shows an [attr-2] and is either [attr-1] or carries a thematic core while lacking a fixed readability classification.

That’s it — same logic, same node IDs, laid out in a calmer, more conversational tone so you can read and apply it easily. If you’d like, I can also produce a compact checklist or a flowchart-style view that follows the exact same logic for quick annotation.
