[STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
A story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if the story starts with a preposition. Operationally, this is a binary annotation assigned when the initial lexical token of the narrative functions as a preposition (i.e., the opening token’s part-of-speech corresponds to a prepositional category).

[USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if the story uses discourse markers. This label denotes the presence of explicit connective elements or pragmatic markers (for example: however, therefore, meanwhile, moreover) that signal discourse relations or shifts.

- The story is [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS]
