Overview
- Purpose: This codebook defines labels (nodes) used to classify stories.  
- How to read each entry:
  - Simple nodes state a single observable property.
  - Composite nodes list logical conditions that must hold (using "both", "either", and explicit negation).
- Note: All node IDs are shown in [BRACKET] format and must be preserved exactly.

Atomic (single-condition) nodes
- [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
  - A story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] if: The story is about time travel.

- [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
  - A story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] if: The story is about hidden treasures.

- [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if: The story is philosophical.

- [MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
  - A story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS] if: The story has more than 6 paragraphs.

- [HIGH-READABILITY]
  - A story is [HIGH-READABILITY] if: The story has readability score above 96.1.

- [STYLE-CLASSIC]
  - A story is [STYLE-CLASSIC] if: The story is classic.

- [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
  - A story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS] if: The story is humorous.

- [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
  - A story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES] if: The story is about mystical creatures.

Composite nodes (logical combinations)
- [THEMATIC-DEPTH]
  - A story is [THEMATIC-DEPTH] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
    - The story is not [STYLE-HUMOROUS]

- [NARRATIVE-STYLE]
  - A story is [NARRATIVE-STYLE] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]
      - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]

- [ADVENTURE-ARC]
  - A story is [ADVENTURE-ARC] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
      - The story is not [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]

- [COMPLEX-STORY]
  - A story is [COMPLEX-STORY] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEMATIC-DEPTH]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [ADVENTURE-ARC]
      - The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]

- [EPIC]
  - A story is [EPIC] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [COMPLEX-STORY]
    - The story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS]

Quick annotator checklist
- Verify atomic labels first (topics, styles, counts, readability).
- Evaluate composite labels only after confirming their component nodes.
- For “not” conditions, ensure the negated node does not apply before assigning the composite label.
- Preserve the exact node IDs when recording labels.
