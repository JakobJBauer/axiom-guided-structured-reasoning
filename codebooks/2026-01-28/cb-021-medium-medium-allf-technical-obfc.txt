Purpose: This codebook defines binary annotation predicates over narrative texts. Each predicate is identified by a unique node ID in square brackets. A story “is” a predicate when the predicate's condition is satisfied. Logical composition operators (either, both, exactly one, not) indicate Boolean relationships between predicates.

Definition: [attr-4]
- A story is [attr-4] iff the story's initial token is an adjective.

Definition: [attr-5]
- A story is [attr-5] iff the story's initial token is a noun.

Definition: [attr-8]
- A story is [attr-8] iff the story's overall style can be classified as lighthearted.

Definition: [attr-9]
- A story is [attr-9] iff the story's style exhibits surreal characteristics.

Definition: [attr-7]
- A story is [attr-7] iff the story's tone is humorous.

Definition: [attr-11]
- A story is [attr-11] iff the story contains the theme Problem-Solving.

Definition: [attr-10]
- A story is [attr-10] iff the story contains the theme Deception.

Definition: [attr-3]
- A story is [attr-3] if exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is [attr-5]
- (Semantically: [attr-3] represents the exclusive disjunction of [attr-4] and [attr-5].)

Definition: [attr-12]
- A story is [attr-12] if either of the following is true:
  - The story's style is in the set { [attr-8], [attr-7] }
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-9]
    - The story is not [attr-10]
- (Semantically: [attr-12] is true when the style is lighthearted or humorous, or when the style is surreal provided deception is absent.)

Definition: [attr-2]
- A story is [attr-2] if either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-10]
  - The story is [attr-11]
- (Semantically: logical disjunction of the two theme predicates.)

Definition: [attr-6]
- A story is [attr-6] if the following equality holds:
  - [attr-8] = [attr-7]
- (Semantically: [attr-6] is true when [attr-8] and [attr-7] have identical truth values for the given story.)

Definition: [attr-1]
- A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-12]
    - The story is [attr-2]
- (Semantically: [attr-1] requires that the story's start-token classification is exclusive and that exactly one of the two higher-level conditions (playful tone vs. deception/problem theme) holds.)

Notes for annotators:
- Treat each predicate as a Boolean property evaluated against the full text.
- Preserve the exclusivity and equality semantics as specified.
- Do not alter node IDs, logical operators, or the composition structure when applying or extending these definitions.
