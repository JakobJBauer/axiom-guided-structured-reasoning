Somewhere in the library of stories, each label waits like a lantern hung on a branch, ready to be lit when a tale meets its truth. Let me walk you through those lanterns — each one a rule, each one precise — and tell the little tale of how a story earns its badge. I’ll keep the exact signs in brackets so you can always find them again.

[MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
A story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS] if The story has more than 6 paragraphs.
- Think of this as the threshold for a sprawling chapter: once a tale stretches past six paragraphs, the [MANY-PARAGRAPHS] lantern glows.

[STYLE-CLASSIC]
A story is [STYLE-CLASSIC] if The story is classic.
- This label is for narratives that wear tradition like an old coat—steady, time-honored, unmistakably classic.

[HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
A story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] if The story has a cliffhanger.
- When a tale snaps its thread at an edge and leaves readers hanging, the [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] flag unfurls.

[STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
A story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if The story starts with a preposition.
- Some stories begin by stepping into place: if the opening line opens with a preposition, this marker appears.

[THEME-DECEPTION]
A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if The story has the theme Deception.
- This lantern burns bright for tales of trickery, misdirection, and secrets revealed too late.

[STYLE-PLAYFUL]
A story is [STYLE-PLAYFUL] if The story is playful.
- When the tone is light, mischievous, or delightfully irreverent, the [STYLE-PLAYFUL] badge fits snugly.

[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if The story has the theme Helping Others.
- This sign marks narratives built around generosity, rescue, and compassionate acts.

[THEME-AGENCY]
A story is [THEME-AGENCY] if The story has the theme Agency.
- When characters act with will and influence—shaping their world rather than being shaped—the [THEME-AGENCY] lamp is lit.

[HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
A story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] if The story has juxtaposition.
- Where contrasts stand shoulder to shoulder—light and dark, old and new—the juxtaposition badge is placed.

[STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if The story is philosophical.
- This is the quiet, reflective sign for tales that ask the big questions and linger on meaning.

[RICH-THEME]
A story is [RICH-THEME] if either of the following is true:
- The story is both [THEME-DECEPTION] and not [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEME-AGENCY]
  - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
- Picture [RICH-THEME] as a layered tapestry: it appears when deception dominates without a helping hand, or when the story’s moral force is decisively one way—either agency or helping others, but not both at once. The rule above states this precisely.

[COMPLEX-CLASSIC-ARC]
A story is [COMPLEX-CLASSIC-ARC] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is both [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] and not [STYLE-PLAYFUL]
  - The story is both [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] and [RICH-THEME]
- Imagine the [COMPLEX-CLASSIC-ARC] lantern as the grand seal for a classic tale that also carries a twist: it must be classic, and then either it leaves you on an earnest cliffhanger (not playful), or it begins with a preposition and wears the layered identity of [RICH-THEME]. The structure above keeps those possibilities exact.

There — the lanterns are lit and their rules are intact. Each bracketed sign stays where it belongs; each condition still governs when a story earns its light. Read these lines as both map and myth: precise rules dressed in a little storytelling glow.
