Codebook — Structured Reference for Annotation

Overview
- Purpose: Provide a clear, hierarchical presentation of each node and its logical conditions so annotators can reason consistently.
- Format: Each node ID is shown in [attr-2] form (unchanged). Atomic nodes are listed first; composite nodes follow with their logical structure preserved (Either / Both / Exactly one / Not).

Quick annotation tips (how to use this codebook)
- Read atomic nodes first; mark them as true/false for the text.
- Evaluate composite nodes by following the preserved logical structure exactly: respect "either", "both", and "exactly one".
- Use the indentation to track nesting: inner bullets represent sub-conditions that affect the parent node.
- When you see "not", negate only the referenced node as shown.

End — All node IDs, logical relationships, and formulas are preserved.
