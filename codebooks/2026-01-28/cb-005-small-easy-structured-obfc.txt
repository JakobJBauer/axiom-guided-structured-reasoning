Title: Codebook — Structured Definitions and Annotation Guidance

Overview
- Purpose: Provide clear, structured definitions for each annotation node and the exact conditions that make a story satisfy composite nodes.
- Use: Annotators should mark atomic features first, then evaluate composite nodes based on those markings.
- Constraint reminders:
  - All node IDs are shown exactly as [attr-1] identifiers and must not be altered.
  - Logical relationships (e.g., AND) are preserved; composite nodes require the specified constituent nodes to be true.

Atomic (single-condition) Nodes
- [attr-8]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if the story uses discourse markers.
  - Quick check: Look for words or phrases that signal structure or transitions (e.g., however, meanwhile, on the other hand).

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if the story has juxtaposition.
  - Quick check: Identify clear placing of contrasting or side-by-side scenes, ideas, or images.

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if the story is about mystical creatures.
  - Quick check: The theme or central subject concerns creatures with supernatural or mythical qualities.

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the story has a Red Herring.
  - Quick check: Spot misleading clues or elements intended to distract from the true explanation.

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if the story is about giant creatures.
  - Quick check: The narrative centers on very large creatures as a primary topic.

Composite (multi-condition) Nodes
- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-7]
    - The story is [attr-5]
  - Logical form: [attr-2] = AND([attr-7], [attr-5])
  - Annotator action: Only mark this node when both constituent nodes have been independently marked true.

- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-6]
    - The story is [attr-4]
  - Logical form: [attr-3] = AND([attr-6], [attr-4])
  - Annotator action: Only mark this node when both constituent nodes have been independently marked true.

Annotation Workflow (ordered, practical)
1. Read the story fully.
2. Mark atomic nodes first:
   - Evaluate and set truth for each of: [attr-8], [attr-5], [attr-7], [attr-4], [attr-6].
3. Evaluate composite nodes:
   - For [attr-2], confirm both [attr-7] and [attr-5] are true.
   - For [attr-3], confirm both [attr-6] and [attr-4] are true.
4. Record results; do not alter node IDs or logical relationships.

Notes and Tips for Consistency
- Composite nodes only become true when all listed constituent nodes are true (logical AND).
- Do not infer composite truth without first verifying each component independently.
- Keep labels exact: use the bracketed node IDs as given when recording or reporting annotations.
