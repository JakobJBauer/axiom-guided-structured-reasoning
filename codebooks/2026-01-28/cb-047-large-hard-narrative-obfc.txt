Think of this codebook as a gallery of labeled doors. Each door bears a bracketed name and a precise lock — a rule that tells you when the door opens. Walk with me through the hall: I will whisper a short story about each door, and then place the exact key beside it so you can test it yourself.

[attr-6]
Sometimes a tale reads like a glass of clean water — effortless and bright. The rule for this door is simple and unyielding:
A story is HIGH-READABILITY if The story has readability score above 96.1

[attr-7]
Other tales are misty and dense, where the path grows narrow and you must strain to see. This door registers that fog:
A story is LOW-READABILITY if The story has readability score below 86.4

[attr-13]
Some stories open on a solid object, a person, or a place — a noun standing at the threshold. That’s the sign on this door:
A story is STARTS-WITH-NOUN if The story starts with a noun

[attr-12]
Others begin in motion or manner, with an adverb nudging the sentence forward like a gust of wind. This is its marker:
A story is STARTS-WITH-ADVERB if The story starts with a adverb

[attr-20]
There are stories that look back with a completed glance — sentences shaped by the perfect aspect, which gives memory its architecture:
A story is USES-PERFECT-ASPECT if The story uses perfect aspect

[attr-19]
Some narrators guide you with signposts — however, therefore, meanwhile — the discourse markers that stitch scenes together:
A story is USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS if The story uses discourse markers

[attr-3]
And then there are endings that leave you hanging, perched on the lip of a sentence and unable to breathe until the next page:
A story is HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER if The story has a cliffhanger

[attr-5]
At times the writer places two images side by side, their contrast humming with meaning — that is juxtaposition, a deliberate pairing:
A story is HAS-JUXTAPOSITION if The story has juxtaposition

[attr-4]
Sometimes the path deliberately misleads; a false trail set to divert our expectations — a red herring tucked into the prose:
A story is HAS-A-RED-HERRING if The story has a Red Herring

[attr-11]
A compact tale can hit like a pebble — brief, precise, under 160 words. This door measures that brevity:
A story is SHORT-STORY if The story has fewer than 160 words

[attr-15]
Some voices weigh questions and palaber — a philosophical style that leans into thought:
A story is STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL if The story is philosophical

[attr-16]
Others smile and flick their wrist, playful in tone and mischievous in rhythm:
A story is STYLE-PLAYFUL if The story is playful

[attr-14]
And sometimes humor threads through lines, inviting laughter as a companion:
A story is STYLE-HUMOROUS if The story is humorous

[attr-18]
Some tales are built around the notion of agency — characters acting, choosing, reshaping their fate:
A story is THEME-AGENCY if The story has the theme Agency

[attr-9]
Picture the opening tone as a hinge that depends on both manner and mood — it swings open only when certain conditions meet. The rule reads like a conditional duet:
A story is OPENING-TONE if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-13]
  - The story is [attr-12]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-15]
  - The story is [attr-16]

[attr-8]
Pace is a creature of two possible births: it can be born from shortness combined with clarity, or it may arise from retrospection that remains lucid. The door’s inscription preserves those twin pathways:
A story is NARRATIVE-PACE if either of the following is true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-11]
  - The story is [attr-6]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-20]
  - The story is not [attr-7]

[attr-1]
Comedy here is a carefully assembled contraption — it requires a playful or humorous spirit, a precise exclusivity about brevity or connective markers, and a twist: either a red herring or a juxtaposition. The mechanism is spelled out exactly:
A story is COMEDIC-STRUCTURE if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-16]
  - The story is [attr-14]
- Both of the following are true:
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-11]
    - The story is [attr-19]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story is [attr-5]

[attr-17]
When theme and tone entwine — agency braided with philosophical opening or a clever one-off twist between juxtaposition and red herring — you witness thematic fusion. Its blueprint reads like a choice between two distinct partnerships:
A story is THEMATIC-FUSION if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-18]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-15]
    - The story is [attr-9]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is [attr-4]

[attr-10]
A rapture ending sings with tension: either an unresolved cliffhanger that stretches across a longer work, or the dramatic flip where exactly one of cliffhanger or red herring is present. The law of this threshold is precise:
A story is RAPTURE-ENDING if either of the following is true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - The story is not [attr-11]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - The story is [attr-4]

[attr-2]
Finally, imagine a tapestry woven from thematic fusion and comedic machinery, capped by either a fleet narrative pace or a rapture ending that sacrifices high readability. That combined pattern defines the most intricate door in the corridor:
A story is COMPLEX-STORY if both of the following are true:
- All of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-17]
  - The story is [attr-1]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-8]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-10]
    - The story is not [attr-6]

You’ve walked the hall and can now see each lock and key. Keep the bracketed names and these exact rules beside you when you annotate — they are the map, and the map must remain unchanged even as the stories themselves roam free.
