Interviewer: Let’s go through this codebook together. First up — what does [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] mean?

Expert: A story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] if The story uses perfect aspect.

Interviewer: Clear. And the topical categories?

Expert: Sure.
- A story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] if The story is about cultural traditions.
- A story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] if The story is about the arts.

Interviewer: How about tone or style?

Expert: A story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] if The story is lighthearted.

Interviewer: Now I see some nodes that combine these. How is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL] defined?

Expert: A story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
- The story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]

Interviewer: So it must be both about the arts and about cultural traditions — got it. What about [NOSTALGIC-ARTS]? That sounds more specific.

Expert: Right. A story is [NOSTALGIC-ARTS] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL]
- The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
- The story is not [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]

Interviewer: Let me paraphrase to check I’ve got it: [NOSTALGIC-ARTS] requires being an arts/cultural traditions story, using the perfect aspect, and explicitly not being lighthearted. Is that accurate?

Expert: Exactly.

Interviewer: And finally, is there a lighthearted counterpart to [NOSTALGIC-ARTS]?

Expert: Yes. A story is [LIGHT-ARTS-TRADITION] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL]
- The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]

Interviewer: Great — that keeps the logical structure tidy: basic labels, an intersection for traditional arts, then two branches that depend on aspect and tone. Anything else to note?

Expert: Nothing changes in the logic or IDs. Each definition is precise: simple predicates for single labels, "both of the following are true" for two-way And, and "all of the following are true" when three conditions (including a Not) must hold. All node IDs remain as shown.
