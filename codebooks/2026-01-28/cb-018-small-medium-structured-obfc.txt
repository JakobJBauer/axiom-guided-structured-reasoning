Codebook — Structured Reference for Annotation
(Each entry shows the node ID in brackets, the concise definition, and the exact logical conditions you must check. Logical operators and node IDs are preserved exactly.)

1) Core / Simple labels
- [attr-7]
  - Definition: Marks stories whose central theme is helping others.
  - Rule: A story is [attr-7] if The story has the theme Helping Others.

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: Marks stories written in a philosophical style or that emphasize philosophical reflection.
  - Rule: A story is [attr-6] if The story is philosophical.

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: Marks stories that present a classic style (traditional conventions, period cadence, or classic storytelling approach).
  - Rule: A story is [attr-4] if The story is classic.

- [attr-1]
  - Definition: Marks stories that explicitly use juxtaposition (contrasting elements placed together for effect).
  - Rule: A story is [attr-1] if The story has juxtaposition.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: Marks stories that present a modern style (contemporary techniques, modern voice, or modernist sensibilities).
  - Rule: A story is [attr-5] if The story is modern.

2) Composite label: mixed-style with juxtaposition
- [attr-2]
  - Purpose: Identifies stories that combine juxtaposition with exactly one of the classic/modern styles (but not both).
  - Rule: A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-1]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-4]
      - The story is [attr-5]
  - Annotator checklist:
    - Confirm presence of juxtaposition.
    - Confirm the story is either classic or modern, but not both.
    - If both classic and modern apply, do NOT assign [attr-2].

3) Higher-level composite: philosophical + helping-others with dramatic condition
- [attr-3]
  - Purpose: Flags stories with a philosophical treatment and a helping-others theme, with special handling when mixed-style juxtaposition is present.
  - Rule: A story is [attr-3] if either of the following is true:
    - All of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-6]
      - The story is [attr-7]
      - The story is not [attr-2]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-2]
      - The story is not [attr-7]
  - Annotator checklist (step-by-step):
    1. Option A (primary path):
       - Is the story philosophical? (assign [attr-6])
       - Does it have the Helping Others theme? (assign [attr-7])
       - Is it NOT a [attr-2] story? If all three answers are true → assign [attr-3].
    2. Option B (alternate path):
       - Is the story a [attr-2]? If yes, then check:
       - Is the story NOT [attr-7]? If both are true → assign [attr-3].
    3. If neither option A nor option B is satisfied → do NOT assign [attr-3].

Quick practical notes (keeps the pragmatic logic intact)
- Always evaluate simple labels ([STYLE-...], [THEME-...], [attr-1]) first. Composite nodes depend on those.
- For "Exactly one of the following is true", treat this as exclusive-or: only assign that branch if exactly one of the listed sublabels is present.
- For "All of the following are true" and "Both of the following are true", require every listed condition to hold.
- Do not change node IDs or the logical operators when annotating. Use the exact relationships above to determine each composite label.
