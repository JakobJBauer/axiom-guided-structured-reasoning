Here’s the same codebook rewritten in a relaxed, conversational voice—smooth and readable, but with every logical connection preserved exactly as before. I’ve kept all node IDs in [BRACKET] form, retained the logical operators and structures (both/either/exactly one/not), and left every relationship and formula untouched. Read through at your own pace; each entry explains the condition in a human-friendly way while keeping the formal logic intact.
