Codebook — Structured Reference for Annotation

Purpose
- This document presents a clear, organized view of the annotation labels (node IDs) and their exact logical definitions.
- Follow these definitions precisely when deciding whether a story satisfies a label.
- Node IDs are shown in [attr-1] format and must be used unchanged.

1) Atomic (single-condition) labels
- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if the story has circular narrative structure.

- [attr-12]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-12] if the story has the theme Kindness.

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the story has juxtaposition.

- [attr-13]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-13] if the story is about hidden treasures.

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if the story has readability score below 86.4.

- [attr-10]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-10] if the story is philosophical.

- [attr-9]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-9] if the story is modern.

- [attr-11]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-11] if the story has the theme Deception.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if the story has readability score above 96.1.

2) Composite (multi-condition) labels
- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-9]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-10]
      - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story is not [attr-3]

- [attr-8]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-12]
    - The story is [attr-11]
    - The story is [attr-7]

- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-8]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - Exactly one of the following is true:
        - The story is [attr-6]
        - The story is [attr-5]
      - The story is [attr-13]

3) Quick annotation checklist (use this to reason through each composite label)
- To decide [attr-7]:
  1. Is [attr-9] true?
  2. Is at least one of [attr-10] or [attr-4] true?
  3. Is [attr-3] false?
  - All three must hold for [attr-7] to apply.

- To decide [attr-8]:
  - Confirm [attr-12], [attr-11], and [attr-7] are all true.

- To decide [attr-2]:
  1. Confirm [attr-8] is true.
  2. Then confirm at least one of:
     - Exactly one of [attr-6] or [attr-5] is true (but not both).
     - OR [attr-13] is true.
  - Both step 1 and step 2 must be satisfied.

Notes for annotators
- Maintain exact logical relationships when labeling.
- "Either" and "Exactly one" are distinct:
  - "Either" means one or more of the listed options (at least one).
  - "Exactly one" means only one of the listed options, not more.
- "Not" negates the listed condition (the condition must be false).
