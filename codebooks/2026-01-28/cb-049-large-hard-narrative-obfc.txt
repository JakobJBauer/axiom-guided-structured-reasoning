[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if the story has a cliffhanger — that breathless pause that leaves readers dangling, hungry for what comes next.

[attr-18]
A story is [attr-18] if the story is modern — set or styled with contemporary sensibilities and voice.

[attr-25]
A story is [attr-25] if the story uses discourse markers — those little signposts (like “however,” “meanwhile,” or “on the other hand”) that guide the reader through turns of thought.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if the story has a flashback — a backward glance that folds past scenes into the present.

[attr-24]
A story is [attr-24] if the story has the theme Problem-Solving — when overcoming obstacles and finding solutions is central to the tale.

[attr-12]
A story is [attr-12] if the story starts with an adjective — its opening word colors the scene immediately.

[attr-26]
A story is [attr-26] if the story uses wh-questions — who, what, when, where, why, or how that probe and pique curiosity.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if the story has juxtaposition — placing contrasting elements side by side so their differences sing.

[attr-13]
A story is [attr-13] if the story starts with an adverb — an opening that modifies the action and sets the tempo.

[attr-23]
A story is [attr-23] if the story has the theme Humor — laughter or light irony woven into what it means.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if the story has readability score below 86.4 — a denser path for readers to follow.

[attr-15]
A story is [attr-15] if the story is humorous — it aims to amuse and delight.

[attr-17]
A story is [attr-17] if the story is minimalist — spare, essential, saying more with less.

[attr-16]
A story is [attr-16] if the story is lighthearted — buoyant, easygoing, and unheavy.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if the story has readability score above 96.1 — effortlessly gliding along for most readers.

[attr-22]
A story is [attr-22] if the story has the theme Deception — trickery, concealment, or the art of misleading.

[attr-19]
A story is [attr-19] if the story is philosophical — contemplative, probing big questions.

[attr-14]
A story is [attr-14] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-3]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is [attr-5]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-25]
  - The story is not [attr-3]
Imagine [attr-14] as the structural toolbox: it’s present if the tale dangles a cliffhanger, or if it uses exactly one of flashback or juxtaposition, or if it pairs discourse markers with the absence of a cliffhanger.

[attr-8]
A story is [attr-8] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-12]
  - The story is [attr-13]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-26]
  - The story is [attr-25]
Think of [attr-8] as the front-door choreography: the story must begin with an adjective or an adverb, and then choose exactly one path — either it asks wh-questions or it guides with discourse markers.

[attr-20]
A story is [attr-20] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - The story is not [attr-17]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-15]
  - The story is not [attr-19]
[attr-20] captures tone as a pair of possible identities: either a modern, lighthearted piece that is not minimalist, or a humorous work that keeps a philosophical bent at bay.

[attr-21]
A story is [attr-21] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-24]
  - The story is [attr-23]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-22]
  - The story is [attr-24]
The heart, [attr-21], pulses when problem-solving and humor beat together, or when the tale embraces exactly one of deception or problem-solving.

[attr-10]
A story is [attr-10] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- The story is [attr-6]
[attr-10] insists on a single readability lane: either below the lower threshold or above the higher one — never both.

[attr-11]
A story is [attr-11] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-10]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-16]
  - The story is not [attr-7]
When [attr-11] arrives, it melds readability classification with tone: the story must belong to a readability class, and either be lighthearted or avoid low readability.

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-14]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-8]
    - The story is not [attr-3]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-20]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-21]
    - The story is not [attr-19]
Think of [attr-2] as the story’s magnetic field: it needs structural hooks or a particular opening pattern without cliffhangers, and it must carry the right stylistic tone or a thematic core that is not philosophical.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-11]
  - The story is [attr-20]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-15]
  - The story is [attr-17]
[attr-1] is the polish at the end: either readability impact and tone align, or the story wears exactly one of two styles — humorous or minimalist — that makes it ready for its readers.

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-2]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-1]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-21]
    - The story is not [attr-10]
Finally, [attr-9] is the summit: the tale must meet the engagement pattern, and then either be audience-ready, or possess a thematic core while not fitting neatly into a readability class. It’s the narrative arc that feels both compelling and complete.
