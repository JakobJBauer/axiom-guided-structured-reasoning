Interviewer: Let's go through this codebook together. First, can you define the simple labels—those that state a single property?

Expert: Sure. I'll read each one and then give a short conversational clarification.

Interviewer: What is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]?

Expert: A story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] if The story has a cliffhanger.

Interviewer: [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]?

Expert: A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if The story is philosophical.

Interviewer: Great. Now let's move to the composite, logical definitions. Start with [STRUCTURAL-DEVICES].

Expert: Okay. Here’s the formal definition and how to read it.

A story is [STRUCTURAL-DEVICES] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
  - The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
  - The story is not [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]

Interviewer: Let me clarify—so [STRUCTURAL-DEVICES] holds if any one of those three high-level cases is satisfied: it has a cliffhanger; exactly one of flashback or juxtaposition; or it uses discourse markers but does not have a cliffhanger. Right?

Expert: Exactly. The logical structure—either / exactly one / both with a negation—stays as written.

Interviewer: Next: [OPENING-PATTERN].

Expert: A story is [OPENING-PATTERN] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
  - The story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]

Interviewer: So to tag [OPENING-PATTERN], the story must start with an adjective or an adverb, and then exactly one of wh-questions or discourse markers must appear. Understood.

Interviewer: Now [STYLE-TONE].

Expert: A story is [STYLE-TONE] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - The story is not [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
  - The story is not [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]

Interviewer: Note the first conjunction: it requires "in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]" and not minimalist. The second option is humorous but not philosophical. Clear.

Interviewer: [THEMATIC-CORE]?

Expert: A story is [THEMATIC-CORE] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
  - The story is [THEME-HUMOR]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]

Interviewer: So [THEMATIC-CORE] either requires both Problem-Solving and Humor, or exactly one of Deception or Problem-Solving. Got it.

Interviewer: [READABILITY-CLASS]?

Expert: A story is [READABILITY-CLASS] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [LOW-READABILITY]
- The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]

Interviewer: That enforces a mutually exclusive classification between low and high readability. Clear.

Interviewer: [READABILITY-IMPACT]?

Expert: A story is [READABILITY-IMPACT] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [READABILITY-CLASS]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - The story is not [LOW-READABILITY]

Interviewer: So for READABILITY-IMPACT, you first must be in the readability class, and then either the story is lighthearted or it is not low-readability. Understood.

Interviewer: [ENGAGEMENT-PATTERN]?

Expert: A story is [ENGAGEMENT-PATTERN] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STRUCTURAL-DEVICES]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [OPENING-PATTERN]
    - The story is not [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-TONE]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEMATIC-CORE]
    - The story is not [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]

Interviewer: That's a two-part conjunction. The first part accepts either STRUCTURAL-DEVICES or a specific OPENING-PATTERN without cliffhanger. The second part accepts STYLE-TONE or THEMATIC-CORE provided it's not philosophical. Correct.

Expert: Correct. The "both of the following are true" at the top level requires one condition from each of those two big choices.

Interviewer: Now [AUDIENCE-READY]?

Expert: A story is [AUDIENCE-READY] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [READABILITY-IMPACT]
  - The story is [STYLE-TONE]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
  - The story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST]

Interviewer: So to be audience-ready, either it meets both readability impact and style tone, or it is exactly one of humorous or minimalist. Clear.

Interviewer: Finally, [OPTIMAL-ARC].

Expert: A story is [OPTIMAL-ARC] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [ENGAGEMENT-PATTERN]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [AUDIENCE-READY]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEMATIC-CORE]
    - The story is not [READABILITY-CLASS]

Interviewer: So OPTIMAL-ARC requires an engagement pattern, plus either the story is audience-ready, or it has thematic core but lacks a readability class. That preserves the intended trade-off between engagement, audience fit, and thematic strength. Perfect.

Interviewer: Anything else we should note about reading and using this transcript-style codebook?

Expert: A couple of practical notes:
- Whenever you see "either of the following is true", treat that as logical OR.
- "Both of the following are true" is logical AND.
- "Exactly one of the following is true" is exclusive OR: one true, the other false.
- "The story is not [NODE]" is logical negation.
- All node IDs appear exactly as [THIS], and their relationships and formulas are unchanged from the original spec.

Interviewer: Thanks—that keeps the formal logic intact while making the definitions easy to talk through.

Expert: You're welcome. If you want, we can walk through an example story and annotate which nodes apply, step by step.
