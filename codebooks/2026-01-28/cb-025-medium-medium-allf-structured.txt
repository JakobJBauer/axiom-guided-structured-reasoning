2) Composite nodes (multiple logical conditions)
- [RICH-NARRATIVE]
  - Summary: Use this label when all listed conditions below hold simultaneously.
  - Formal condition: A story is [RICH-NARRATIVE] if all of the following are true:
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
      - The story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
      - The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
    - The story is not [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
    - At least one of the story's structural features is in the set { [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER], [HAS-A-FLASHBACK], [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] }

  - Notes for annotation:
    - “Either … is true” means at least one of the two listed structural features must be present.
    - “Exactly one … is true” requires an exclusive choice between the two listed features (one present, the other absent).
    - The final set membership requirement must hold even if it overlaps with earlier conditions.

- [COMPLEX-STORY]
  - Summary: This label requires that the story be both narratively rich and satisfy two style/theme relationships simultaneously.
  - Formal condition: A story is [COMPLEX-STORY] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [RICH-NARRATIVE]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - Either of the following is true:
        - The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
        - The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
      - The presence of [STYLE-MODERN] equals the presence of [STYLE-CLASSIC]

  - Notes for annotation:
    - “Either … is true” in the nested condition: at least one of [THEME-KINDNESS] or [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON] must be present.
    - “The presence of [STYLE-MODERN] equals the presence of [STYLE-CLASSIC]” means these two style labels must match in presence — either both are present or both are absent.
    - All conditions above must be satisfied together for [COMPLEX-STORY] to apply.

3) Quick checklist (for annotators)
- To mark [RICH-NARRATIVE], verify:
  - At least one of [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] or [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] is true.
  - Exactly one of [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] or [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] is true.
  - [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] is false.
  - At least one of { [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER], [HAS-A-FLASHBACK], [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] } is true.

- To mark [COMPLEX-STORY], verify:
  - The story already meets all requirements for [RICH-NARRATIVE].
  - At least one of [THEME-KINDNESS] or [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON] is true.
  - [STYLE-MODERN] and [STYLE-CLASSIC] either both appear or both do not appear.
