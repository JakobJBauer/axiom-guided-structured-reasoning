I'll walk you through this codebook in a more conversational, free-flow voice while keeping every technical detail exactly where it belongs. The node IDs remain unchanged in [attr-3] form, and all logical relationships—Not, And, Or, Exactly one, and so on—are preserved exactly as in the original. Think of this as a friendly guide that gently explains what each label means, then repeats the precise logical rules you need for annotation.

[attr-15]
Call a story [attr-15] when its overall tone is lighthearted — playful, breezy, or gently amusing. In short: if the story is lighthearted, it gets this tag.

[attr-17]
Tag a story [attr-17] when it leans into philosophical ideas, reflections, or questions. If the story is philosophical, it’s [attr-17].

[attr-25]
Use [attr-25] for stories that take place in or are centrally about enchanted, uncanny, or distinctly magical lands. If the story is about magical lands, it’s [attr-25].

[attr-27]
If a story explicitly uses wh-questions (who, what, where, when, why, how), label it [attr-27].

[attr-12]
When the whole piece is concise — under 160 words — mark it [attr-12].

[attr-19]
If kindness is a core theme of the tale, assign [attr-19].

[attr-8]
When the story is broken into more than six paragraphs, use [attr-8].

[attr-26]
If the narrative makes use of the conditional mood (would, could, might, etc.), give it [attr-26].

[attr-21]
If problem-solving drives the story’s theme — characters working out puzzles, challenges, or obstacles — mark [attr-21].

[attr-18]
When growth (personal, moral, or otherwise) is a clear theme, label the story [attr-18].

[attr-13]
If the very first word of the story is a preposition (in, on, under, before, etc.), tag it [attr-13].

[attr-22]
Use [attr-22] when giant creatures are a central subject of the story.

[attr-16]
If the story reads as modern in style — contemporary voice, modern settings or sensibilities — call it [attr-16].

[attr-14]
If the story has a classic style — timeless structure, older conventions, or a classic voice — mark it [attr-14].

[attr-20]
When magic itself is an explicit theme, use [attr-20].

[attr-24]
If the story is about lost civilizations, ancient ruins, or rediscovered cultures, tag [attr-24].

[attr-5]
If a flashback appears in the narrative, give it [attr-5].

[attr-23]
Stories centered on hidden treasures, secret hoards, or buried riches should carry [attr-23].

[attr-10]
A story is [attr-10] if the story is not [attr-15]. In other words, apply this when the story is explicitly not lighthearted.

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-16]
- The story is [attr-14]

[attr-7]
Think of [attr-7] as a special kind of adventure that must meet both of these conditions:
- The story is [attr-25]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-20]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-22]
    - The story is [attr-21]

[attr-6]
Label a story [attr-6] when it fits either of these possibilities:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-23]
  - The story is [attr-24]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-23]
  - The story is [attr-24]

[attr-11]
Use [attr-11] for stories that have a wh-question device and either a conditional mood or begin with a preposition:
- [attr-27] is in the set of devices the story uses (it explicitly uses wh-questions)
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-26]
  - The story is [attr-13]

[attr-4]
An [attr-4] is a tightly specified kind of growth story. Two big requirements must both be met:
- The set of themes in the story is equal to the set containing [attr-19] and [attr-18]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-21]
    - The story is [attr-5]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-8]
    - The story is not [attr-12]

[attr-1]
An [attr-1] happens in one of two ways:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-6]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-22]
  - The story is [attr-24]

[attr-2]
Finally, [attr-2] captures a particular, layered combination. A story is this if either of these two larger blocks applies:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-1]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-9]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-19]
      - The story is [attr-20]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is not [attr-10]
    - The story is [attr-11]

That’s the whole codebook, rewritten in a friendlier flow but keeping every ID, every logical condition, and every relationship just as originally specified. Use these labels exactly as defined when annotating or reasoning about stories.
