Prelude — an enchanted prologue:
In a sun-dappled library where labels bloom like flowers upon the shelves of countless tales, this codebook lives as a gardener of categories. Each bracketed sigil is a petal or a thorn: precise in its place, exact in its meaning, yet whispered about in lyrical, curious prose so that annotators may both reason with rigor and delight in the language as they read. Below, every pact of logic is preserved; the formal conditions stand firm, and around them I have woven gentle, flowery commentary to illuminate their purpose.

Each bracketed title above is both a rule and a lantern: the formal condition is written plainly to guide annotation, and the flowery commentary is meant to illuminate purpose and help readers remember. The logical bones remain unaltered; only the surrounding language has been gilded so that this codebook can be both exact and delightful to read.
