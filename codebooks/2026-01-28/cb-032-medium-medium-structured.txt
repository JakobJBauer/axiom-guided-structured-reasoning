Codebook — Structured definitions for story labels

Notes for annotators
- All node IDs are shown in [BRACKET] format exactly as required.
- Logical relations (Not, And, Or, Exactly one, Either, Both) are preserved as written. Do not change these when applying labels.
- Use the definitions below to decide whether a story satisfies each node.

1) Simple (atomic) labels
- [MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
  - Definition: A story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS] if the story has more than 6 paragraphs.
  - Quick check: Count paragraph breaks; label when > 6.

- [STYLE-CLASSIC]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-CLASSIC] if the story is classic.
  - Quick check: Use your sense of "classic" style (conventional structure, tone, or genre conventions).

- [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] if the story has a cliffhanger.
  - Quick check: The ending or a chapter leaves a major unresolved tension.

- [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if the story starts with a preposition.
  - Quick check: The very first word is a preposition (e.g., "In", "On", "At", "By", etc.).

- [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception.
  - Quick check: Central plot or characters revolve around lying, trickery, or betrayal.

- [STYLE-PLAYFUL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-PLAYFUL] if the story is playful.
  - Quick check: Tone is light, whimsical, or mischievous.

- [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if the story has the theme Helping Others.
  - Quick check: Core motivation or actions emphasize assistance, altruism, or rescue.

- [THEME-AGENCY]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-AGENCY] if the story has the theme Agency.
  - Quick check: Characters take independent action; focus on choice and control.

- [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] if the story has juxtaposition.
  - Quick check: Contrasting elements are placed side-by-side for effect.

- [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if the story is philosophical.
  - Quick check: Reflective, idea-driven tone, exploring questions about meaning or existence.

2) Compound labels (preserve logical structure exactly)
- [RICH-THEME]
  - Definition: A story is [RICH-THEME] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is both [THEME-DECEPTION] and not [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [THEME-AGENCY]
      - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - Interpretation tips:
    - First branch: label [RICH-THEME] when Deception is present and Helping Others is absent.
    - Second branch (Exactly one): label [RICH-THEME] when exactly one of Agency or Helping Others applies (i.e., XOR).

- [COMPLEX-CLASSIC-ARC]
  - Definition: A story is [COMPLEX-CLASSIC-ARC] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is both [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] and not [STYLE-PLAYFUL]
      - The story is both [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] and [RICH-THEME]
  - Interpretation tips:
    - First required condition: the story must be [STYLE-CLASSIC].
    - Second required condition: at least one of the two sub-conditions must hold:
      - Sub-condition A: It has a cliffhanger and it is not playful.
      - Sub-condition B: It begins with a preposition and meets [RICH-THEME].

3) Quick decision flow (how to think through annotations)
- Step 1: Apply atomic labels (section 1) independently.
- Step 2: Evaluate [RICH-THEME]:
  - If Deception present and Helping Others absent → [RICH-THEME] = true.
  - Else, if exactly one of Agency or Helping Others is true → [RICH-THEME] = true.
  - Otherwise → [RICH-THEME] = false.
- Step 3: Evaluate [COMPLEX-CLASSIC-ARC]:
  - If not [STYLE-CLASSIC] → [COMPLEX-CLASSIC-ARC] = false.
  - If [STYLE-CLASSIC] and either (Has cliffhanger and not playful) or (Starts with preposition and [RICH-THEME]) → [COMPLEX-CLASSIC-ARC] = true.
