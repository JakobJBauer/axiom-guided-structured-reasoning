Overview
- Purpose: A compact, structured codebook for annotators. Each entry names a node (ID in [BRACKET] form) and explains the exact condition(s) under which a story should be labeled with that node.
- Read this as a checklist: atomic nodes are single properties; composite nodes combine those properties with logical operators (And, Or, Xor, Not, Equal, In). The logical structure and all node IDs are preserved exactly.

Atomic (single-condition) nodes
- [SHORT-STORY]
  - Definition: A story is [SHORT-STORY] if the story has fewer than 160 words.
  - How to check: Count words; label if count < 160.

- [THEME-KINDNESS]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-KINDNESS] if the story has the theme Kindness.

- [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if the story has the theme Helping Others.

- [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] if the story has the theme Problem-Solving.

- [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if the story is philosophical.

- [HIGH-READABILITY]
  - Definition: A story is [HIGH-READABILITY] if the story has readability score above 96.1.
  - How to check: Use the specified readability metric; label when score > 96.1.

- [STYLE-PLAYFUL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-PLAYFUL] if the story is playful.

- [THEME-HUMOR]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-HUMOR] if the story has the theme Humor.

- [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS] if the story is humorous.

- [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY] if the story has a story within a story.

- [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES] if the story is about mystical creatures.

- [HAS-A-RED-HERRING]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-RED-HERRING] if the story has a Red Herring.

Composite (multi-condition) nodes
- [KINDNESS-HELPING]
  - Logical structure: both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
    - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - Interpretation: Use And — label only when both theme nodes apply simultaneously.

- [LIGHT-HEARTED]
  - Logical structure: a story is [LIGHT-HEARTED] if exactly one of the following is true (Xor):
    - The story is [STYLE-PLAYFUL]
    - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
  - Interpretation: Use Xor — label when one style is present and the other is absent.

- [THEME-IN-CORE-SET]
  - Logical structure: A story is [THEME-IN-CORE-SET] if the story's dominant theme is In the following set:
    - [THEME-KINDNESS], [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS], [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
  - Interpretation: Use In — membership among these three theme nodes determines the label (dominant theme must be one of them).

- [BALANCED-TONE]
  - Logical structure: A story is [BALANCED-TONE] if the following Equal relationship holds:
    - The presence of [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] Equal the presence of [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
  - Interpretation: Use Equal — label when both are present or both are absent (parity of presence).

- [MYSTICAL-ALLEGORY]
  - Logical structure: A story is [MYSTICAL-ALLEGORY] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
    - The story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY] And the story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - Interpretation: This nests an And inside an And (topic AND (story-within-a-story AND philosophical)) to capture allegorical structure.

- [COMPLEX-ARC]
  - Logical structure: A story is [COMPLEX-ARC] if all of the following are true:
    1. Either of the following is true (Or):
       - The story is [KINDNESS-HELPING]
       - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
    2. Exactly one of the following is true (Xor):
       - The story is [HAS-A-RED-HERRING]
       - The story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
    3. The story is Not [SHORT-STORY] Or the story is [HIGH-READABILITY]
  - Interpretation: Combine Or and Xor to shape arc complexity. The Not in clause excludes very short works unless they meet [HIGH-READABILITY]; all three conditions must hold.

- [RECOMMENDABLE-COMPOSITION]
  - Logical structure: A story is [RECOMMENDABLE-COMPOSITION] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [COMPLEX-ARC] And the story is [BALANCED-TONE]
    2. The story is [THEME-IN-CORE-SET] And either of the following is true (Or):
       - The story is [LIGHT-HEARTED]
       - The story is [MYSTICAL-ALLEGORY]
  - Interpretation: Top-level And combines two branches:
    - Branch A: quality-of-arc (COMPLEX-ARC) plus tonal parity (BALANCED-TONE)
    - Branch B: thematic core membership (THEME-IN-CORE-SET) plus one of (LIGHT-HEARTED or MYSTICAL-ALLEGORY)
  - Note: This node intentionally references multiple logical operators (And, Or, Xor, Not, Equal, In) through its subordinate nodes.

Quick annotator checklist (how to apply labels in practice)
- Evaluate atomic properties first (themes, styles, topics, structural features, length, readability).
- Use those atomic labels as inputs to composite nodes, following the exact logical operators shown (And, Or, Xor, Not, Equal, In).
- For Xor: label only when exactly one operand is present.
- For Equal: label when both operands share presence/absence (both present or both absent).
- For In: check dominance/membership among listed theme nodes.
- Preserve nesting: when a composite node references another composite (e.g., [KINDNESS-HELPING] inside [COMPLEX-ARC]), apply the inner logic first.

End note
- The logical relationships, node IDs, and operators are preserved exactly as specified. Use this structured layout to make annotation consistent, fast, and logically transparent.
