Interviewer: [attr-7]?

Expert: A story is [attr-7] if the story has readability score above 96.1.

Interviewer: Now let's move to compound definitions. Start with [attr-9]. How is that defined?

Expert: A story is [attr-9] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-6]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-12]
  - The story is [attr-11]

Interviewer: So it needs juxtaposition plus either a preposition start or short length. Clear. What about [attr-10]?

Expert: A story is [attr-10] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-9]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-25]
  - The story is [attr-15]

Interviewer: That "exactly one" is important — it rules out both or neither. Next, [attr-2]?

Expert: A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-23]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-16]
  - The story is [attr-10]

Interviewer: So it's arts plus either philosophical style or that specific juxtapositional/superlative condition. Got it. Now [attr-8] — this one looks more layered.

Expert: A story is [attr-8] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-20]
  - The story is [attr-13]
- All of the following are true:
  - The story is not [attr-15]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-14]
    - The story is [attr-25]

Interviewer: To paraphrase: it must be humorous by theme or style, must not be minimalist, and must have exactly one of lighthearted style or superlatives. Correct. Let's continue: [attr-1]?

Expert: A story is [attr-1] if either of the following is true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-19]
    - The story is [attr-21]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-17]
  - The story is [attr-18]

Interviewer: So it can be a moral lesson tied to helping or kindness, or exactly one of deception or hardship. The name hints at tension between altruism and contraction. Good. Finally, [attr-3] — the big one.

Expert: A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-2]
    - The story is [attr-1]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-8]
    - The story is [attr-22]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-24]
    - The story is [attr-5]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-11]
    - The story is [attr-7]

Interviewer: Let me restate that to ensure I have the logic right. For [attr-3], you need one of two higher-level clusters on the first axis: either both [attr-2] and [attr-1], or exactly one of [attr-8] or [attr-22]. And on the second axis, you need either time-travel with circular narrative, or a short story with very high readability. Is that accurate?

Expert: Exactly. You captured the logical structure precisely.

Interviewer: Thanks — that walkthrough makes the codebook much easier to follow. Any final tips for annotators using these definitions?

Expert: Yes — always check each atomic node first (the simple labels like [attr-20] or [attr-11]) and then apply the compound rules exactly as written: pay careful attention to "Either," "Both," "All," "Exactly one," and negations like "The story is not [attr-15]." Those words determine the logical flow and must be treated literally when annotating.
