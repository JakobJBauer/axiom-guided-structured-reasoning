Codebook — Structured Edition

Purpose: Provide a clear, organized reference for annotators. Each node (ID in [BRACKET]) defines a predicate about a story. The logical relationships (And, Or, Not, Xor, Equal) and node IDs are preserved exactly as in the original codebook.

    - The story is [READABILITY-AND-START]
    - The story is [MORAL-OR-GROWTH]

Notes for annotators (pragmatic guidance)
- Read each atomic predicate literally: these are the building blocks used by the composite nodes.
- For "Or" blocks: satisfying any listed sub-node makes the parent true.
- For "And" blocks: every listed sub-node must be true for the parent to hold.
- For "Xor": exactly one of the listed options must be true — not zero, not both.
- For "Equal(...)": follow the equality of truth values as specified.
- The phrase "Not the story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]" must be interpreted as logical negation (the story must not be [STYLE-CLASSIC]) when evaluating [COMPLEX-STORY-TYPE].

This structured layout preserves all node IDs, logical operations, and relationships unchanged while organizing the content for easier, systematic annotation.
