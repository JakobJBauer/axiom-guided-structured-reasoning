Codebook — Structured Reference for Annotation
Purpose
- Provide a clear, organized set of labels and their exact logical definitions to guide consistent story annotation.
- Preserve the original logic: do not change node IDs, logical operators (Not, And, Or, exactly one, all), or formula structure.

How to use this document
- Evaluate the simple (atomic) labels first, then use those results to evaluate composite labels.
- When a composite label requires "exactly one" or "all," apply the literal interpretation:
  - "Exactly one of the following is true" means count exactly one true item from the listed options.
  - "All of the following are true" means every listed item must be true.
  - "Not" indicates the negation of the given label.

Atomic labels (single-condition definitions)
- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the story has readability score below 86.4

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if the story is philosophical

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if the story is modern

- [attr-12]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-12] if the story uses superlative forms

- [attr-10]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-10] if the story is about bygone eras

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if the story has the theme Magic

- [attr-11]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-11] if the story is about time travel

- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if the story has a moral lesson

- [attr-8]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if the story has the theme Problem-Solving

Composite labels (logical combinations)
- [attr-9]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-9] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-11]
    - The story is [attr-7]

- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-2] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-10]
    - The story is [attr-3]
    - The story is not [attr-12]

- [attr-1]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-1] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-9]
    - The story is [attr-8]
    - The story is not [attr-4]

Quick annotation checklist (recommended order)
1. Compute and record readability score; mark [attr-4] accordingly.
2. Label topical and stylistic atoms:
   - [attr-11], [attr-7], [attr-10]
   - [attr-6], [attr-5], [attr-8]
   - [attr-3], [attr-12]
3. Evaluate composite labels using the exact logical rules above:
   - For [attr-9], ensure exactly one of the two listed atoms is true.
   - For [attr-2] and [attr-1], ensure every listed condition holds (and the negated items are indeed false).

Notes and tips for consistent judgments
- Binary decisions: Treat each label as true or false; avoid partial assignments.
- Negations: When a composite requires "not [attr-13]," explicitly confirm that [attr-13] has been judged false.
- "Exactly one" requires careful counting; if both or neither of the options are true, [attr-9] is false.
- Keep records of which atomic labels led to each composite label — this improves traceability and dispute resolution.
