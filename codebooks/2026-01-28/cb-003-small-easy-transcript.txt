Interviewer: Let's walk through this codebook together. First, what does [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] mean?

Expert: Good question. [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] applies when a story starts with a preposition. In other words: a story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if the story starts with a preposition.

Interviewer: Clear. How about [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] — what should an annotator look for?

Expert: [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] is used when the story employs discourse markers. Concretely: a story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if the story uses discourse markers.

Interviewer: And [THEME-DECEPTION] — that sounds thematic. What does it label?

Expert: Right. [THEME-DECEPTION] marks the presence of deception as a theme. Precisely: a story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception.

Interviewer: There are a few topic labels too. Explain [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS].

Expert: Sure. [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS] is assigned when the story concerns magical lands. To be exact: a story is [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS] if the story is about magical lands.

Interviewer: What about [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]?

Expert: [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] flags stories focused on cultural traditions. Formally: a story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] if the story is about cultural traditions.

Interviewer: And [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]?

Expert: [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] covers stories about the arts. Specifically: a story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] if the story is about the arts.

Interviewer: Now there's a composite label, [ARTFUL-DECEPTION-IN-FANTASY]. How do we determine that?

Expert: Good catch — this one combines conditions. [ARTFUL-DECEPTION-IN-FANTASY] applies when all of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS]
- The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
- The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]

Interviewer: So to summarize, each bracketed label corresponds to a single, checkable property, and [ARTFUL-DECEPTION-IN-FANTASY] requires all three of those properties simultaneously.

Expert: Exactly. Keep the node IDs and those relationships intact when annotating: each label is evaluated as stated, and the composite label requires the conjunction of the three specified labels.
