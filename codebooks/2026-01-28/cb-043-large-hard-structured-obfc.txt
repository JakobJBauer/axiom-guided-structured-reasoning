Structured Codebook (preserving all node IDs and logical relations)

Overview
- This document restates each node and its exact logical conditions in a clear, hierarchical layout.
- Atomic predicates are listed first (simple labels about a story). Composite predicates follow, using the same logical operators as the original: both of the following are true, either of the following is true, exactly one of the following is true, The story is not [attr-9], and equality checks (equals true).
- All node IDs are unchanged and all logical relationships and operations are preserved exactly.

A. Atomic labels (simple one-line definitions)
- [attr-20]
  - A story is [attr-20] if The story has the theme Innovation
- [attr-21]

  - A story is [attr-2] if The story has a cliffhanger

- [attr-5]
  - A story is [attr-5] if The story has more than 6 paragraphs

B. Simple derived label
- [attr-10]
  - A story is [attr-10] if [attr-5] equals true

C. Composite predicates (preserve original logical constructs)

- [attr-13]
  - A story is [attr-13] if both of the following are true:
    - exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-11]
      - The story is [attr-12]
    - The story is in [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL, STYLE-MINIMALIST]

- [attr-7]
  - A story is [attr-7] if either of the following is true:
    - both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-22]
      - The story is [attr-23]
    - exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-22]
      - The story is [attr-24]

- [attr-6]
  - A story is [attr-6] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-19]
    - both of the following are true:
      - exactly one of the following is true:
        - The story is [attr-18]
        - The story is [attr-17]
      - The story is not [attr-14]

- [attr-16]
  - A story is [attr-16] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-20]
    - either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-6]
      - both of the following are true:
        - The story is [attr-21]
        - The story is [attr-25]

- [attr-8]
  - A story is [attr-8] if both of the following are true:
    - either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-4]
      - The story is [attr-2]
    - either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-3]
      - The story is not [attr-4]

- [attr-1]
  - A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-16]
    - either of the following is true:
      - both of the following are true:
        - The story is [attr-13]
        - either of the following is true:
          - both of the following are true:
            - The story is [attr-8]
            - The story is [attr-10]
          - The story is [attr-7]
      - both of the following are true:
        - The story is [attr-8]
        - The story is not [attr-14]

Notes for annotators (guidance only; does not change logic)
- Read each node as a precise label: "A story is [attr-9] if <conditions>".
- Follow the exact logical operators shown (both / either / exactly one / not). The nesting matters—conditions under a given bullet belong to that operator.
- Use atomic labels (Section A) to evaluate composite nodes (Section C). Do not infer extra relationships beyond what is written here.
