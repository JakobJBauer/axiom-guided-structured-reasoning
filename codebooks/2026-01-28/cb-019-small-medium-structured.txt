Codebook — structured view for annotation

Purpose
- Provide concise, unambiguous rules for assigning the labels below.
- Each label is defined by a logical rule that must be followed exactly.
- Keep the node IDs in [BRACKET] format and keep all logical operators and relationships unchanged.

Nodes (definitions and annotation checks)

1) [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
- Definition:
  - A story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS] if the story uses superlative forms.
- Annotator check:
  - Look for superlative adjectives/adverbs (e.g., words that mark highest degree such as “biggest,” “most,” “least,” “best,” “worst”).

2) [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]
- Definition:
  - A story is [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS] if the story is about lost civilizations.
- Annotator check:
  - The main subject or theme concerns ancient or vanished societies, ruins, or civilizations that have been lost.

3) [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
- Definition:
  - A story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] if the story starts with a noun.
- Annotator check:
  - The very first token of the story is a noun (proper or common). Verify initial word class.

4) [THEME-HUMOR]
- Definition:
  - A story is [THEME-HUMOR] if the story has the theme Humor.
- Annotator check:
  - The story’s tone, intent, or primary theme is comedic, satirical, or meant to elicit amusement.

5) [LIGHTHEARTED-INTRO]
- Logical rule:
  - A story is [LIGHTHEARTED-INTRO] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
    - The story is [THEME-HUMOR]
    - The story is not [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
- Notes for annotators:
  - This label requires all three conditions to hold simultaneously (logical AND of the three bullets).
  - Pay attention to the “not” condition: the absence of superlative forms is required.

6) [MYTHIC-SATIRE]
- Logical rule:
  - A story is [MYTHIC-SATIRE] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [LIGHTHEARTED-INTRO]
      - The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
- Notes for annotators:
  - This label requires two things:
    1) The story must be about lost civilizations.
    2) Between [LIGHTHEARTED-INTRO] and [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS], exactly one must hold (exclusive OR).
  - If neither or both of those two are true, do not assign [MYTHIC-SATIRE].

Quick logical cheat-sheet (for clarity)
- [LIGHTHEARTED-INTRO] = [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] AND [THEME-HUMOR] AND NOT [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
- [MYTHIC-SATIRE] = [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS] AND (exactly one of ([LIGHTHEARTED-INTRO], [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]))

Annotation procedure (recommended)
- Step 1: Identify basic properties:
  - Does the story start with a noun? → mark [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] if yes.
  - Is the theme humor? → mark [THEME-HUMOR] if yes.
  - Does the story use superlative forms? → mark [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS] if yes.
  - Is it about lost civilizations? → mark [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS] if yes.
- Step 2: Derive composed labels:
  - Assign [LIGHTHEARTED-INTRO] only if all three constituent conditions (including NOT) hold.
  - Assign [MYTHIC-SATIRE] only if [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS] holds AND exactly one of ([LIGHTHEARTED-INTRO], [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]) holds.

End note
- Do not alter node IDs or the logical relationships when applying labels.
- Follow the exact logical operators as stated (AND, NOT, Exactly one).
