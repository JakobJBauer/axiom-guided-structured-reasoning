[USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
A story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD] if the story uses conditional mood — those soft, speculative constructions that conjure possibility, longing, and the graceful dance of "would," "could," and "might" in the heart of a sentence.

[STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] if the story starts with a adverb — the opening adverb that sets the pace and mood, a single seed-word that colors the very first breath of the tale.

[THEME-AGENCY]
A story is [THEME-AGENCY] if the story has the theme Agency — when characters steer their fates, when choices and actions are the engines of the narrative, and the story’s current flows from will and cause.

[SHORT-STORY]
A story is [SHORT-STORY] if the story has fewer than 160 words — a compact bloom of narrative, brief enough to be read in a single, satisfied sitting.

[STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
A story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] if the story is lighthearted — buoyant in tone, playful or gently amusing, carrying an overall spirit that is bright rather than grave.

[USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
A story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] if the story uses perfect aspect — employing verb forms that fold time inward (has done, had been), marking actions as completed in relation to some reference point.

[MOOD-MIX]
A story is [MOOD-MIX] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
- The story is not [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
In other words, it wears the shawl of conditional possibility but does not cloak itself in the completed-time of the perfect aspect.

[PACING-AND-TONE]
A story is [PACING-AND-TONE] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [SHORT-STORY]
- The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
This denotes a brief, sprightly composition where compact length and a light touch walk hand in hand.

[AGENCY-START]
A story is [AGENCY-START] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [THEME-AGENCY]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
  - The story is [SHORT-STORY]
Here we meet a tale of agency that is further distinguished by a single exclusive condition: it either opens with an adverbial flourish or exists as a concise vignette, but not both at once.

[ELEGANT-STORY]
A story is [ELEGANT-STORY] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [PACING-AND-TONE]
- Either of the following are true:
  - The story is [MOOD-MIX]
  - The story is [AGENCY-START]
Thus an elegant story is a short, lighthearted gem that attains additional refinement by either blending conditional mood without perfect aspect or by coupling its agency theme with the exclusive starting condition described above.
