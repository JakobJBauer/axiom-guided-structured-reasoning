Think of this as a friendly guide to the tags and how we decide when a story gets one of them. I’ll keep the exact logical rules as written — the node IDs and their relationships remain untouched — but explain them in a more conversational, flowing way so they’re easier to read and use.

[HAS-A-RED-HERRING]
Call a story [HAS-A-RED-HERRING] when, simply put, the story contains a Red Herring.

[MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
A story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS] if it runs longer than six paragraphs.

[STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
Tag a story as [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] when its tone is lighthearted.

[HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]
A story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN] if it features Chekhov’s gun — that telling detail that turns out to matter later.

[THEME-MAGIC]
A story is [THEME-MAGIC] when Magic is one of its themes.

[TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
Use [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] for stories that are about the arts.

[USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
Label a story [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] when it makes use of the perfect aspect in its verb forms.

[THEME-INNOVATION]
A story is [THEME-INNOVATION] if Innovation is a theme in the story.

[THEME-GROWTH]
A story is [THEME-GROWTH] when Growth is one of its themes.

[STYLE-CLASSIC]
Call a story [STYLE-CLASSIC] if it reads as classic in style.

[STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
A story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if its opening begins with a preposition.

[TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
Use [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] when the story is about cultural traditions.

[TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]
A story is [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS] if it concerns lost civilizations.

[THEME-DECEPTION]
A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if Deception is a theme that runs through it.

[USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
Tag a story [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] if it includes wh-questions (who, what, where, when, why, how).

[TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
A story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS] when it’s about bygone eras.

[STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
Mark a story as [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] if the first word is an adjective.

[NARRATIVE-SURPRISE]
Think of [NARRATIVE-SURPRISE] as the tag for stories that combine certain twisty elements. A story is [NARRATIVE-SURPRISE] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [HAS-A-RED-HERRING]
  - The story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Exactly one of [THEME-DECEPTION] and [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] is true
  - The story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS]

So you need one of the trick items (red herring or Chekhov’s gun) plus either an exclusive choice between deception and wh-questions or a long form (many paragraphs).

[RICH-LENGTH]
A story is [RICH-LENGTH] when both of the following are true:
- The story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
- The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]

That is, a long piece that also uses the perfect aspect.

[CLASSIC-VS-MODERN]
Use [CLASSIC-VS-MODERN] for stories that fit this mix: all of the following must hold:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]
  - The story is [STYLE-MODERN]
- The story is not [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]

So it’s either classic or modern (but not both), not lighthearted, and it opens with either a preposition or an adjective.

[CULTURAL-PAST-THEME]
A story is [CULTURAL-PAST-THEME] if either of these two paths holds:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
  - The story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]
  - Exactly one of [THEME-GROWTH] and [THEME-DECEPTION] is true

So it’s about cultural or historical subjects — either traditions plus bygone eras, or lost civilizations with an exclusive tilt toward growth or deception.

[INNOVATION-GROWTH-MIX]
A story is [INNOVATION-GROWTH-MIX] if either of the following holds:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [THEME-INNOVATION]
  - The story is [THEME-GROWTH]
- All of the following are true:
  - The story is [THEME-INNOVATION]
  - The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
  - The story is not [THEME-GROWTH]

So it’s about innovation and growth together, or innovation focused on the arts without growth.

[ARTS-ROOT]
A story is [ARTS-ROOT] when both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [INNOVATION-GROWTH-MIX]
  - The story is [CULTURAL-PAST-THEME]

In short: it’s an arts story that ties into either the innovation-growth mix or cultural/past themes.

[EPIC-ARTS-MYSTERY]
Finally, a story is [EPIC-ARTS-MYSTERY] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [ARTS-ROOT]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [NARRATIVE-SURPRISE]
    - The story is [RICH-LENGTH]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [CLASSIC-VS-MODERN]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [CULTURAL-PAST-THEME]
    - The story is [INNOVATION-GROWTH-MIX]

So to earn [EPIC-ARTS-MYSTERY], the story must meet one of two high-level paths: be rooted in the arts (directly) or pair narrative surprise with rich length — and additionally either fit the classic-vs-modern constraints or combine cultural-past themes with the innovation-growth mix.

That’s the whole map, laid out plainly: the same logical backbone, but phrased so you can read it like a conversation about what each tag really means.
