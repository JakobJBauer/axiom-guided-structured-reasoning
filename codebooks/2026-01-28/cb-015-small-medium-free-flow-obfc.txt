Think of this as a little glossary for tagging stories — short, plain, and a bit conversational so it's easier to remember what each label really means.

[attr-4]
Call a piece [attr-4] when it’s under 160 words. Simple as that: fewer than 160 words makes it a short story.

[attr-5]
If the story centers on magic, give it the [attr-5] label — the theme is Magic.

[attr-7]
If the story contains wh-questions — who, what, when, where, why, how — mark it as [attr-7].

[attr-1]
When some element set up early plays a required role later (Chekhov’s gun), the story is [attr-1].

[attr-2]
A story earns [attr-2] when its readability score is above 96.1.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is not [attr-1]

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-4]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is not [attr-2]
    - The story is [attr-7]

That’s it — the labels stay the same, the logical relationships are preserved, and you can use this wording as a friendly checklist while annotating and reasoning about stories.
