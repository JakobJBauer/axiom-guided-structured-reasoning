Codebook — Structured Reference for Annotation
Purpose
- Provide a clear, organized set of labels and their exact logical definitions to guide consistent story annotation.
- Preserve the original logic: do not change node IDs, logical operators (Not, And, Or, exactly one, all), or formula structure.

How to use this document
- Evaluate the simple (atomic) labels first, then use those results to evaluate composite labels.
- When a composite label requires "exactly one" or "all," apply the literal interpretation:
  - "Exactly one of the following is true" means count exactly one true item from the listed options.
  - "All of the following are true" means every listed item must be true.
  - "Not" indicates the negation of the given label.

Atomic labels (single-condition definitions)
- [LOW-READABILITY]
  - Definition: A story is [LOW-READABILITY] if the story has readability score below 86.4

- [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if the story is philosophical

- [STYLE-MODERN]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-MODERN] if the story is modern

- [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
  - Definition: A story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS] if the story uses superlative forms

- [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS] if the story is about bygone eras

- [THEME-MAGIC]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-MAGIC] if the story has the theme Magic

- [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] if the story is about time travel

- [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON] if the story has a moral lesson

- [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] if the story has the theme Problem-Solving

Composite labels (logical combinations)
- [TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS]
  - Definition: A story is [TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
    - The story is [THEME-MAGIC]

- [DIDACTIC-BYGONE]
  - Definition: A story is [DIDACTIC-BYGONE] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
    - The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
    - The story is not [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]

- [COMPLEX-ARC]
  - Definition: A story is [COMPLEX-ARC] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS]
    - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
    - The story is not [LOW-READABILITY]

Quick annotation checklist (recommended order)
1. Compute and record readability score; mark [LOW-READABILITY] accordingly.
2. Label topical and stylistic atoms:
   - [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL], [THEME-MAGIC], [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
   - [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL], [STYLE-MODERN], [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
   - [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON], [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
3. Evaluate composite labels using the exact logical rules above:
   - For [TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS], ensure exactly one of the two listed atoms is true.
   - For [DIDACTIC-BYGONE] and [COMPLEX-ARC], ensure every listed condition holds (and the negated items are indeed false).

Notes and tips for consistent judgments
- Binary decisions: Treat each label as true or false; avoid partial assignments.
- Negations: When a composite requires "not [X]," explicitly confirm that [X] has been judged false.
- "Exactly one" requires careful counting; if both or neither of the options are true, [TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS] is false.
- Keep records of which atomic labels led to each composite label — this improves traceability and dispute resolution.
