**Interviewer:** We’re going to annotate stories using a few nodes. Can you start by telling me what **[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]** means?

**Annotator:** Sure. A story is **[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]** if the story has the theme *Helping Others*.

---

**Interviewer:** Got it. What about **[TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]**—when do we apply that?

**Annotator:** A story is **[TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]** if the story is about mystical creatures.

---

**Interviewer:** And there’s one about how the story begins, right? **[STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]**?

**Annotator:** Exactly. A story is **[STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]** if the story starts with a preposition.

---

**Interviewer:** Now it looks like we start combining things. Can you explain **[MYTHIC-BUT-NOT-ALTRUISTIC]**?

**Annotator:** Yes—this one is a two-part test, and **both** parts have to be true. A story is **[MYTHIC-BUT-NOT-ALTRUISTIC]** if both of the following are true:  
- The story is **[TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]**  
- The story is **not [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]**

**Interviewer:** So it’s mystical creatures *and* explicitly not a helping-others theme.

**Annotator:** Right—**And** plus a **Not**.

---

**Interviewer:** Last one: **[INVITING-OPENING]**. This sounds like it’s also built from other nodes?

**Annotator:** It is. A story is **[INVITING-OPENING]** if both of the following are true:  
- The story is **[STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]**  
- The story is **not [MYTHIC-BUT-NOT-ALTRUISTIC]**

**Interviewer:** So it starts with a preposition, and it must *not* fall into that “mystical but not helping others” category.

**Annotator:** Exactly—again, **both** conditions must hold: **And** with a **Not** applied to **[MYTHIC-BUT-NOT-ALTRUISTIC]**.
