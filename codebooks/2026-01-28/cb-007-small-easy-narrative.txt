In the little kingdom of Annotation, five curious badges live in plain sight, each with a simple rule that decides when a tale may wear it. Imagine walking through a sunlit fair where these badges gossip about stories — playful, precise, and punctual — and then meet the elder badge that only appears when a specific combination of friends come together. Listen in as their rules are told like small tales, clear as law but told with a wink.

[STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
A story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] if the story is lighthearted.

[STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] if the story starts with a adverb.

[LONG-STORY]
A story is [LONG-STORY] if the story has more than 375 words.

[THEME-HUMOR]
A story is [THEME-HUMOR] if the story has the theme Humor.

[TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
A story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS] if the story is about bygone eras.

Then there is the elder badge, [WHIMSY-RETRO-COMEDY], who sits at the crossroads of mood and theme. It will only crown a tale when a tidy, two-part ritual is satisfied — a ritual that asks for both lightness of tone and a specific brand of humor, and even then it waits for one of two possible finishing touches.

[WHIMSY-RETRO-COMEDY]
A story is [WHIMSY-RETRO-COMEDY] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
- The story is [THEME-HUMOR] and either of the following is true:
  - The story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]

Think of it as a short parable: for the elder to smile, a story must be lighthearted, and it must carry the spirit of humor — plus either a nostalgic nod to bygone eras or the playful flourish of beginning with an adverb. Keep these rules close when you annotate; they are firm, but simple, and they tell the tale as clearly as any fable.
