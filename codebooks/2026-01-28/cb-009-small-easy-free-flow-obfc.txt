Think of this as a friendly guide to the labels we use when annotating stories — each label is followed by the exact condition that makes it apply. I’ll keep things natural and easy to read, but the logical structure stays intact: the node IDs in [attr-1] form, the connective words, and the formula shapes are unchanged.

[attr-8]
A story is [attr-8] if The story uses superlative forms

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if The story uses perfect aspect

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if The story is about lost civilizations

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if The story has juxtaposition

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if The story has fewer than 160 words

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-6]
- The story is [attr-5]

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if either of the following are true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-8]
  - The story is [attr-7]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-3]

That’s it — same nodes, same logic, just presented so it reads like a conversation rather than a dry checklist.
