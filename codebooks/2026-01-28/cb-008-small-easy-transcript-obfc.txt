Interviewer: Let’s go through this codebook together. Can you start with the first entry?

Expert: Sure. [attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if the story is about cultural traditions.

Interviewer: And the next one?

Expert: [attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if the story has a moral lesson.

Interviewer: What about sentences that begin in a certain way — is that captured?

Expert: Yes. [attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if the story starts with an adverb.

Interviewer: Is there a node for the magic theme?

Expert: There is. [attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if the story has the theme Magic.

Interviewer: Now, how do these pieces combine? Is there a composite label that requires more than one condition?

Expert: Yes — here's the combined rule. [attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-4]
- The story is [attr-3]
- The story is [attr-1]

Interviewer: So to be clear, a story must satisfy all three of those subconditions to be marked [attr-5], right?

Expert: Exactly. All three must hold together for [attr-5] to apply.
