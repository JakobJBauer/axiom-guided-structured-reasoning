Technical codebook — categorical definitions and logical composition rules

Notation: Each bracketed token [NODE-ID] denotes a categorical label assigned to a narrative (hereafter "story"). The schema uses propositional classification: atomic predicates define base properties; compound predicates specify Boolean combinations of those atomic predicates. The connective language (both of the following are true / either of the following is true / all of the following are true / not) encodes logical AND, OR, universal conjunction, and negation, respectively. Node identifiers and logical relationships are fixed and must not be altered.
