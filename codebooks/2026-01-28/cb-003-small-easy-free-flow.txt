Think of this as a short, friendly guide to the tags you’ll use while annotating stories. I’ll describe each label in plain, conversational language so it’s easier to remember — but I won’t change any of the logic or the exact node names you need to use.

A story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if the story starts with a preposition. In other words, if the very first word that opens the piece is a preposition (like "In," "On," "At," "Between," etc.), that’s the cue to mark it with [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION].

A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if the story uses discourse markers. If the narrator or characters rely on words and phrases that structure the flow of conversation or argument — things like "however," "so," "well," "then," "on the other hand," and similar signposts — then apply [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS].

A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception. Whenever trickery, lies, concealment, or intentional misleading is a central part of the narrative or its message, tag the story as [THEME-DECEPTION].

A story is [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS] if the story is about magical lands. Use [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS] when the setting or subject matter centers on fantastical realms — enchanted kingdoms, otherworldly territories, or places where the rules of our world don’t apply.

A story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] if the story is about cultural traditions. When a piece focuses on rituals, customs, community practices, or heritage that define a culture, label it [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS].

A story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] if the story is about the arts. If the narrative deals with painting, music, theater, dance, literature, or other creative practices and their worlds, mark it [TOPIC-THE-ARTS].

A story is [ARTFUL-DECEPTION-IN-FANTASY] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS]
- The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
- The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]

That last tag, [ARTFUL-DECEPTION-IN-FANTASY], is reserved for pieces that sit at the intersection of enchanted settings, artistic subject matter, and deception as a core theme — all three conditions must hold true to apply it.
