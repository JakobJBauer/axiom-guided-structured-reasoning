Codebook — Structured Reference for Annotation

Purpose
- Provide a clear, organized set of definitions and decision checks for annotators.
- Preserve the exact logical relationships between nodes so reasoning remains consistent and reliable.

Atomic (single-condition) nodes
- [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
  - Definition: A story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] if The story uses perfect aspect.
  - Annotation guidance:
    - Look for verb forms that indicate the perfect aspect (e.g., has/have + past participle; had + past participle; has been + past participle).
    - Mark this node true when the story’s narration or description explicitly employs perfect aspect.
- [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] if The story is about cultural traditions.
  - Annotation guidance:
    - Identify content centered on rituals, customs, heritage practices, ceremonies, or community traditions.
    - Mark true when the primary subject matter concerns cultural traditions.
- [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] if The story is about the arts.
  - Annotation guidance:
    - Identify narratives focused on music, visual art, dance, theater, literature, crafts, or artistic practice and appreciation.
    - Mark true when the arts are a main topic.
- [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] if The story is lighthearted.
  - Annotation guidance:
    - Look for tone that is playful, cheerful, whimsical, or otherwise not serious or somber.
    - Mark true when tone and style convey lightness rather than gravity.

Composite (combined-condition) nodes
- [ARTS-TRADITIONAL]
  - Definition: A story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
    - The story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
  - How to decide:
    - Confirm the story is about the arts AND that it specifically ties those arts to cultural traditions.
    - Use both bullets as a checklist — both must hold to mark [ARTS-TRADITIONAL] true.
- [NOSTALGIC-ARTS]
  - Definition: A story is [NOSTALGIC-ARTS] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL]
    - The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
    - The story is not [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - How to decide:
    - First verify [ARTS-TRADITIONAL] is true (arts connected with cultural traditions).
    - Then confirm the narrative uses perfect aspect.
    - Finally confirm the story does not have a lighthearted style (i.e., STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED is false).
    - All three conditions must be satisfied to mark [NOSTALGIC-ARTS] true.
- [LIGHT-ARTS-TRADITION]
  - Definition: A story is [LIGHT-ARTS-TRADITION] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL]
    - The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - How to decide:
    - Confirm the arts are connected to cultural traditions (ARTS-TRADITIONAL) AND the tone is lighthearted.
    - Both bullets must hold to mark [LIGHT-ARTS-TRADITION] true.

Quick annotation checklist (for each story)
- Step 1: Evaluate atomic nodes
  - Is the story about the arts? → [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
  - Is the story about cultural traditions? → [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
  - Does the story use perfect aspect? → [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
  - Is the story lighthearted in style? → [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
- Step 2: Apply composite rules
  - If both [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] and [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] are true → mark [ARTS-TRADITIONAL] true.
  - If [ARTS-TRADITIONAL] AND [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] AND NOT [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] → mark [NOSTALGIC-ARTS] true.
  - If [ARTS-TRADITIONAL] AND [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] → mark [LIGHT-ARTS-TRADITION] true.

Notes on logical relations (preserved semantics)
- “Both of the following are true” indicates a logical AND between exactly the listed conditions.
- “All of the following are true” indicates a logical AND across the listed conditions; presence of “not” indicates negation of that condition.
- Composite nodes depend only on the specified child nodes; no other attributes should be inferred as required.

Use this structured guide to ensure consistent, accurate annotations while keeping the original logical structure and node identifiers intact.
