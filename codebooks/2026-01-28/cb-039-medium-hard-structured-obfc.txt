Codebook — structured, clear, and ready for annotation

Purpose: Each entry below defines a node by its ID (in [attr-1] form) and gives the exact, structured logical criteria you should use when labeling a story. Logical operations and all node IDs are preserved exactly as in the original codebook.

Atomic labels (base predicates)
- [attr-11]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-11] if:
    - The story has the theme Deception.

- [attr-12]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-12] if:
    - The story has the theme Helping Others.

- [attr-9]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-9] if:
    - The story is philosophical.

- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if:
    - The story has Checkhov's gun.

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if:
    - The story starts with a noun.

- [attr-13]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-13] if:
    - The story is about hidden treasures.

- [attr-10]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-10] if:
    - The story has the theme Agency.

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if:
    - The story starts with a adjective.

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if:
    - The story has juxtaposition.

Derived labels (composite logical conditions)
- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-7]
    - The story is [attr-6] xor [attr-7]
  - Notes:
    - Treat this node as true when either the simpler start-with-noun condition holds, or when an exclusive choice between starting with an adjective and starting with a noun applies.

- [attr-8]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [attr-5]
    2. Either of the following is true:
       - Both of the following are true:
         - The story is [attr-11]
         - The story is [attr-13]
       - Either of the following is true:
         - The story is [attr-3] xor [attr-10]
         - The story is [attr-11] and not [attr-10]
  - Structure recap:
    - First require [attr-5].
    - Then satisfy one of two branches:
      - Branch A: both deception theme and hidden-treasures topic; OR
      - Branch B: either (Checkhov's gun xor Agency) OR (Deception and not Agency).

- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-2] if all of the following are true:
    1. The story is [attr-8]
    2. Not both of the following are true:
       - The story is [attr-12]
       - The story is [attr-9]
    3. Either of the following is true:
       - The story is [attr-4]
       - Both of the following are true:
         - The story is [attr-7] equals true
         - The story is [attr-6] equals false
  - Interpretation hints:
    - [attr-2] demands a prior [attr-8] foundation.
    - It excludes the simultaneous presence of Helping Others and Philosophical style.
    - It requires either juxtaposition or a precise opening pattern (explicit equality conditions on start-with flags).

Annotation checklist (practical workflow)
- Step 1: Evaluate atomic predicates (the basic nodes).
- Step 2: Evaluate [attr-5] using its two alternatives (observe xor where stated).
- Step 3: Evaluate [attr-8] by:
  - Confirming [attr-5], then
  - Checking the two main branches (both-deception+hidden-treasures OR the sub-branch with xor/and-not).
- Step 4: Evaluate [attr-2] by:
  - Confirming [attr-8],
  - Ensuring not both Helping-Others and Philosophical hold,
  - Confirming either juxtaposition OR the exact start-with conditions.
- Always preserve logical operators exactly as listed (xor, and not, equals true/false, Not both, Both, Either).
