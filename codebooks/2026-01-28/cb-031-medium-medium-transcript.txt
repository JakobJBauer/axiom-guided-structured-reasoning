Interviewer: Let's go through this codebook node by node. First, what does [LOW-READABILITY] mean?

Expert: A story is [LOW-READABILITY] if the story has readability score below 86.4.

Interviewer: Clear. And the stylistic labels — how are they defined?

Expert: Here they are, simple and direct:
- A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if the story is philosophical.
- A story is [STYLE-MODERN] if the story is modern.
- A story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS] if the story uses superlative forms.

Interviewer: What about topical tags?

Expert: Same straightforward pattern:
- A story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS] if the story is about bygone eras.
- A story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] if the story is about time travel.

Interviewer: And theme labels?

Expert: Yes:
- A story is [THEME-MAGIC] if the story has the theme Magic.
- A story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] if the story has the theme Problem-Solving.
- A story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON] if the story has a moral lesson.

Interviewer: Now we get to the composite nodes. How is [TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS] defined?

Expert: A story is [TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
- The story is [THEME-MAGIC]

Interviewer: So "exactly one" means one or the other, but not both. Got it. Next composite node?

Expert: [DIDACTIC-BYGONE]. The definition is:
A story is [DIDACTIC-BYGONE] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
- The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
- The story is not [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]

Interviewer: That last line uses negation. So the story must not use superlatives. Understood. And the most complex node?

Expert: [COMPLEX-ARC]. It requires multiple conditions:
A story is [COMPLEX-ARC] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS]
- The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
- The story is not [LOW-READABILITY]

Interviewer: Let me summarize to make sure I'm following: [COMPLEX-ARC] needs the exclusive time-or-magic condition from [TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS], plus problem-solving as a theme, and it must not be low-readability. Is that right?

Expert: Exactly. You’ve captured the logical structure: preserve each node identity, apply the specified logical operators (exactly one / all / not), and combine them as written.

Interviewer: Thanks — that keeps the relationships clear for anyone doing annotation or reasoning.

Expert: My pleasure. Each node is defined precisely so annotators can use these rules without ambiguity.
