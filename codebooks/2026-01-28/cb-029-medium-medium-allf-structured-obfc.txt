Overview
- Purpose: Provide a clear, structured reference for annotators. Each entry defines when a story satisfies a given label (node). Atomic labels describe single observable features. Composite labels combine atomic labels using explicit logical operations (And, Or, Not, Exactly one, equality of truth values).
- Notation: Node identifiers are shown in [attr-1] form and must remain exactly as written. Logical relationships (both/either/not/exactly one/truth equality) are preserved verbatim.

Atomic (single-feature) nodes
- [attr-9]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-9] if the story is philosophical.

- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if the story has a story within a story.

- [attr-13]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-13] if the story uses conditional mood.

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the story has circular narrative structure.

- [attr-11]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-11] if the story is about cultural traditions.

- [attr-8]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if the story has fewer than 160 words.

- [attr-12]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-12] if the story is about seasonal changes.

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if the story has readability score below 86.4.

Composite nodes (logical combinations)
- [attr-5]
  - Summary: Conjunction (AND) of two atomic features.
  - A story is [attr-5] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-3]
    - The story is [attr-13]

- [attr-7]
  - Summary: Exclusive condition plus a parity constraint between two other labels.
  - A story is [attr-7] if both of the following are true:
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-9]
      - The story is [attr-4]
    - The truth value of the following are equal:
      - [attr-8]
      - [attr-6]

- [attr-10]
  - Summary: Membership in a small topic set.
  - A story is [attr-10] if the story's topic is in the set:
    - [attr-11]
    - [attr-12]

- [attr-2]
  - Summary: Conjunction of an either/or condition and two additional constraints.
  - A story is [attr-2] if all of the following are true:
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-5]
      - The story is [attr-7]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-10]
      - The story is not [attr-8]

Quick annotator guidance (structured thinking)
- Check atomic labels first (e.g., style, structure, topic, length, readability).
- Use atomic results to evaluate composite nodes in the order presented:
  1. Evaluate [attr-5] (AND of two atomics).
  2. Evaluate [attr-7]:
     - Determine whether exactly one of [attr-9] and [attr-4] holds.
     - Confirm whether [attr-8] and [attr-6] share the same truth value (both true or both false).
     - Both conditions must hold for [attr-7] to be true.
  3. Evaluate [attr-10] by checking whether topic matches either topical node.
  4. Evaluate [attr-2]:
     - Ensure at least one of [attr-5] or [attr-7] is true.
     - Also ensure [attr-10] is true and [attr-8] is false (i.e., story is not [attr-8]).
- Remember: Do not alter node IDs, logical operators, or the specified relationships. Use the definitions above as precise criteria for labeling.
