In a sunlit glade where categories bloom like wildflowers, each label in this humble codex is presented both as a fragrant whisper and as an exact incantation. Below each lyrical preface you will find the precise, unaltered criterion that binds a story to its consecrated name. The laws of connection—those delicate threads of logic—remain untouched; I have only adorned them with petals of description so that the heart may understand what the eyes must apply.

Like an old clock whose hands ache to wander, this tag is reserved for tales that slip sideways through the hours.

Imagine the first word of the tale opening like a painted curtain—if that very opening is an adjective, the story wears this ribbon.

[attr-7]
Think of this as the loom on which circular threads and certain beginnings are woven together; both stipulations below must be satisfied for the pattern to hold:
A story is [attr-7] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is not [attr-8]

[attr-10]
This badge balances humor and lightness with modernity or clarity; it requires an exclusive choice between two tones, and at least one condition of temporal voice or readability to be met:
A story is [attr-10] if both of the following are true:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-11]
  - The story is [attr-12]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-13]
  - The story is not [attr-6]

[attr-1]
This compound wreath recognizes tales that pair the arts with cultural customs and the labor of resolving issues—either by full union of three qualities or by a subtler conjunction of two where one must be exclusive:
A story is [attr-1] if either of the following is true:
- All of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-19]
  - The story is [attr-16]
  - The story is [attr-15]
- Both of the following are true:
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-19]
    - The story is [attr-15]
  - The story is [attr-16]

[attr-3]
At the center of certain mythic blooms lies a core that must embrace exactly one of two enchanted subjects, and then either time travel or the absence of modernity:
A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-17]
  - The story is [attr-18]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-20]
  - The story is not [attr-13]

[attr-2]
Here the tapestry tightens: a narrative-structural weave must be present, and then one of two elaborate combinations must entwine—either style without fantasy-core, or the arts-tradition problem braided with fantasy-core.
A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-10]
    - The story is not [attr-3]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-1]
    - The story is [attr-3]

[attr-14]
Consider this the council of petals: for a story to earn this title, it must be a complex-pattern and must align with either the arts tradition problem or fantasy-core, and enshrine a specific tonal alignment with humor.
A story is [attr-14] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-2]
- The story is [attr-1] or the story is [attr-3]
- The story is [attr-10] equals [attr-11]

[attr-9]
At last comes the archetype: a great garden where complex combinations and singular cores determine whether a tale stands as a syndicate of patterns, a core of fantasy alone, or an arts-tradition problem graced by tone or structure. The following precise pathways describe that destiny:
A story is [attr-9] if either of the following is true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-14]
  - The story is [attr-2] in [COMPLEX-PATTERN, SYNDIC-CONJUNCTION, FANTASY-CORE]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-3] and the story is not [attr-1]
  - The story is [attr-1] and exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-10]
    - The story is [attr-7]

Thus ends the codex of blossoms and logic, where every ornate flourish keeps faithful to its stern stem: the connective rules beneath are preserved exactly so that annotators may wander these gardens with both pleasure and precision.
