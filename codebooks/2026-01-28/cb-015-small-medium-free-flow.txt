Think of this as a little glossary for tagging stories — short, plain, and a bit conversational so it's easier to remember what each label really means.

[SHORT-STORY]
Call a piece [SHORT-STORY] when it’s under 160 words. Simple as that: fewer than 160 words makes it a short story.

[THEME-MAGIC]
If the story centers on magic, give it the [THEME-MAGIC] label — the theme is Magic.

[USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
If the story contains wh-questions — who, what, when, where, why, how — mark it as [USES-WH-QUESTIONS].

[HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]
When some element set up early plays a required role later (Chekhov’s gun), the story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN].

[HIGH-READABILITY]
A story earns [HIGH-READABILITY] when its readability score is above 96.1.

[MYSTERIOUS-MAGIC]
A story is [MYSTERIOUS-MAGIC] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [THEME-MAGIC]
- The story is not [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]

[TIGHT-MAGIC-CRAFT]
A story is [TIGHT-MAGIC-CRAFT] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [SHORT-STORY]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [MYSTERIOUS-MAGIC]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is not [HIGH-READABILITY]
    - The story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]

That’s it — the labels stay the same, the logical relationships are preserved, and you can use this wording as a friendly checklist while annotating and reasoning about stories.
