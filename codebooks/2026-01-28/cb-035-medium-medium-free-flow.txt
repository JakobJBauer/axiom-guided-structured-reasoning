Think of this as a friendly guide to the labels we use when annotating stories. I’ll walk through each tag and what triggers it, keeping the exact logic you rely on — every bracketed node stays the same, and the logical words (both, either, not) remain intact.

[STYLE-MINIMALIST]
A story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST] if the story is minimalist — in other words, it leans into simplicity, pared-down language, and an economy of detail.

[HIGH-READABILITY]
A story is [HIGH-READABILITY] if the story has readability score above 96.1 — a clear numerical cutoff that marks extremely easy-to-read prose.

[USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
A story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS] if the story uses superlative forms — language that goes to the top: best, strongest, most, and the like.

[THEME-GROWTH]
A story is [THEME-GROWTH] if the story has the theme Growth — whenever change, development, or personal/plot expansion is central.

[TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
A story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] if the story is about time travel — any narrative element that involves moving through time.

[TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
A story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] if the story is about hidden treasures — whether literal caches or metaphorical discoveries.

[CLEAR-CONCISE]
A story is [CLEAR-CONCISE] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
- The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]
So [CLEAR-CONCISE] happens when simplicity and very high readability come together.

[EMPHATIC]
A story is [EMPHATIC] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
- The story is not [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
Here, emphasis through superlatives counts only when the piece is not minimalist — it’s loud, not spare.

[THEMATIC-ARC]
A story is [THEMATIC-ARC] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [THEME-GROWTH]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
  - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
So a growth-focused tale becomes a [THEMATIC-ARC] when it pairs that theme with either time travel or hidden treasures.

[COMPELLING]
A story is [COMPELLING] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [CLEAR-CONCISE]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [EMPHATIC]
  - The story is [THEMATIC-ARC]
In short, to be [COMPELLING] a story needs to be clear and concise, plus either strikingly emphatic (without being minimalist) or carrying that growth-oriented thematic arc described above.

That’s the set — same logical structure, just explained in a conversational flow so it’s easier to read and apply.
