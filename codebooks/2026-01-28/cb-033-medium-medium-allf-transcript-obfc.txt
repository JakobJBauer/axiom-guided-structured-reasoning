Interviewer: Let's go through this codebook node by node. Start simple — what does [attr-9] mean?

Expert: A story is [attr-9] if The story has the theme Humor.

Interviewer: And [attr-11]?

Expert: A story is [attr-11] if The story is about lost civilizations.

Interviewer: Style tags next — what is [attr-7]?

Expert: A story is [attr-7] if The story is playful.

Interviewer: [attr-8]?

Expert: A story is [attr-8] if The story is surreal.

Interviewer: How about [attr-12]?

Expert: A story is [attr-12] if The story uses discourse markers.

Interviewer: I see a readability label. Explain [attr-2].

Expert: A story is [attr-2] if The story has readability score below 86.4.

Interviewer: And classic style?

Expert: A story is [attr-5] if The story is classic.

Interviewer: What does [attr-6] capture?

Expert: A story is [attr-6] if The story is philosophical.

Interviewer: Cliffhangers?

Expert: A story is [attr-1] if The story has a cliffhanger.

Interviewer: There's a structural condition about how a story starts. Tell me about [attr-4].

Expert: A story is [attr-4] if The story starts with a preposition.

Interviewer: Now the composite nodes. [attr-10] looks more complex — can you walk me through it precisely?

Expert: Certainly. A story is [attr-10] if either of the following is true:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-6]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-8]
  - The story is not [attr-5]

Interviewer: Let me paraphrase to check I understand: [attr-10] holds when either the story is exactly one of playful or philosophical, or when it’s surreal and explicitly not classic. Is that right?

Expert: Yes — that restates the exact logical structure. Note the important quantifier “Exactly one” for the first option and the conjunction for the second.

Interviewer: Great. Finally, [attr-3] — this looks nested. Please read it carefully.

Expert: A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
- The story is in the following set:
  - [attr-9]
  - [attr-11]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-1]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is equal to [attr-9]
    - The story is not [attr-2]
- Or the story is [attr-10]

Interviewer: That’s a lot to unpack. Can you summarize the logical structure without changing it?

Expert: Sure. For [attr-3] to hold, first the story must be in the set consisting of [attr-9] and [attr-11]. Then one of three paths must be satisfied: (1) it has [attr-1]; (2) it is exactly [attr-9] and not [attr-2]; or (3) it meets [attr-10]. Those are presented under the “Either of the following is true” clause, and the whole thing is governed by the initial “both of the following are true” — the set membership plus that either/or condition — which is then extended with the final “Or the story is [attr-10]” alternative as shown.

Interviewer: Thanks — that preserves the exact logical relationships and node names, but makes the flow easier to follow.

Expert: Exactly. Every node ID, every logical operator (Not, And, Or, Exactly one, Either, Both), and their relationships remain unchanged. This transcript just frames them as a Q&A so annotators can reason through them conversationally.
