Interviewer: Let's go through this codebook line by line. First, what is [attr-7]?

Expert: 
[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if The story uses superlative forms.

Interviewer: Clear. And what about [attr-6]?

Expert:
[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if The story uses perfect aspect.

Interviewer: Good. Now, what does [attr-5] mean?

Expert:
[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if The story is about lost civilizations.

Interviewer: Got it. How about [attr-2]?

Expert:
[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if The story has juxtaposition.

Interviewer: And the length-based tag [attr-4]?

Expert:
[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if The story has fewer than 160 words.

Interviewer: Now for the composed nodes. Walk me through [attr-1].

Expert:
[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-4]

Interviewer: So to label something [attr-1], both conditions must hold at once. Understood. Lastly, explain [attr-3].

Expert:
[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if either of the following are true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-6]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-6]
  - The story is [attr-2]

Interviewer: So for [attr-3], we accept either of two conjunctions: (1) superlatives plus perfect aspect, or (2) perfect aspect plus juxtaposition.

Expert: Exactly. That keeps the logical structure intact: the node requires one of the listed options, and each option itself requires both of its subconditions.
