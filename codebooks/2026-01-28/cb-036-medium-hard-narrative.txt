Imagine a small catalog of traits, each one a lantern hung on the wall of a library of stories. Every lantern bears a bracketed name — the exact keys we use when we read or tag a tale. Below, each lantern is introduced in voice and image, but the rules that light them remain unchanged: the same node IDs in [BRACKET] form, and the same logical gates (Exactly one, Either, Both, And, Not) that decide whether a lantern glows for a given story.

[LOW-READABILITY]
Think of [LOW-READABILITY] as a weary, dim lamp. A story claims this lamp when its readability score has slipped below 86.4 — a simple threshold that marks prose that needs extra care.

[TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
The lantern called [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] flickers when a tale bends clocks and corridors: a story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] if the story is about time travel.

[TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
Outside the windows of this library, seasons turn. When a story turns with them, the [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES] lantern lights: a story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES] if the story is about seasonal changes.

[USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
Some storytellers leave a trail of signposts. The badge [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] is set on a story if the story uses discourse markers — those connective words and phrases that guide a reader’s steps.

[STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
A story wears [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] when its first step is a description: the story starts with an adjective.

[TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
There are maps and buried chests in some tales. If a story is about hidden treasures, it carries the [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] mark.

[THEME-DECEPTION]
When trickery and misdirection thread the plot, the theme of deception appears. A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception.

[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
If a tale turns on kindness, aid, or selfless acts, it earns the [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] badge: the story has the theme Helping Others.

[STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
Sometimes a tale begins with place or relation: a story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if the story starts with a preposition.

[STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
If the opening word is an adverb, the story wears [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB].

[NARRATIVE-SURFACE]
Now meet [NARRATIVE-SURFACE], a composite lantern that glows under a particular pattern of openings and signals. Picture it as a gatekeeper that checks two kinds of evidence and decides by strict rules:

- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [LOW-READABILITY]
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]

In other words, [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] is true if either it finds a solitary flourish at the very start (an adjective or an adverb — but not both), or it finds discourse markers paired with either low readability or an opening preposition. The exact logical scaffolding stays as written: an exclusive choice in the first branch, and an "And" combining discourse markers with an "Or" of readability or preposition in the second.

[INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE]
Finally, the most intricate lantern, [INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE], a mysterious fixture that requires two tall pillars to stand. It glows only when both of the following are true:

- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
      - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
      - The story is not [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
- The story is [NARRATIVE-SURFACE]

Read that slowly like a riddle: the first pillar allows either a time-travel tale that pairs with exactly one of two themes (Deception or Helping Others), or a seasonal-changes tale that also involves hidden treasures and explicitly is not about time travel. The second pillar insists that the piece meet the [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] conditions described above. Only when both pillars stand does [INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE] shine.

Each of these entries preserves the precise logical relationships they govern — the same nodes in their bracketed names and the same logical operations. What I’ve offered is a stitched-together narrative map of how those lanterns light, so you can travel the library of stories with both clarity and a little imagination.
