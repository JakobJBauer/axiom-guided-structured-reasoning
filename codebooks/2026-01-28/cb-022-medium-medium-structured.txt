Codebook — Structured Reference for Annotation

Purpose
- This document presents a clear, organized view of the annotation labels (node IDs) and their exact logical definitions.
- Follow these definitions precisely when deciding whether a story satisfies a label.
- Node IDs are shown in [BRACKET] format and must be used unchanged.

1) Atomic (single-condition) labels
- [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] if the story has circular narrative structure.

- [THEME-KINDNESS]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-KINDNESS] if the story has the theme Kindness.

- [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] if the story has juxtaposition.

- [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] if the story is about hidden treasures.

- [LOW-READABILITY]
  - Definition: A story is [LOW-READABILITY] if the story has readability score below 86.4.

- [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if the story is philosophical.

- [STYLE-MODERN]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-MODERN] if the story is modern.

- [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception.

- [HIGH-READABILITY]
  - Definition: A story is [HIGH-READABILITY] if the story has readability score above 96.1.

2) Composite (multi-condition) labels
- [MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA]
  - Definition: A story is [MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [STYLE-MODERN]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
      - The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
    - The story is not [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]

- [MORAL-AMBIVALENCE]
  - Definition: A story is [MORAL-AMBIVALENCE] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
    - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
    - The story is [MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA]

- [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]
  - Definition: A story is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [MORAL-AMBIVALENCE]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - Exactly one of the following is true:
        - The story is [LOW-READABILITY]
        - The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]
      - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]

3) Quick annotation checklist (use this to reason through each composite label)
- To decide [MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA]:
  1. Is [STYLE-MODERN] true?
  2. Is at least one of [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] or [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] true?
  3. Is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] false?
  - All three must hold for [MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA] to apply.

- To decide [MORAL-AMBIVALENCE]:
  - Confirm [THEME-KINDNESS], [THEME-DECEPTION], and [MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA] are all true.

- To decide [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]:
  1. Confirm [MORAL-AMBIVALENCE] is true.
  2. Then confirm at least one of:
     - Exactly one of [LOW-READABILITY] or [HIGH-READABILITY] is true (but not both).
     - OR [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] is true.
  - Both step 1 and step 2 must be satisfied.

Notes for annotators
- Maintain exact logical relationships when labeling.
- "Either" and "Exactly one" are distinct:
  - "Either" means one or more of the listed options (at least one).
  - "Exactly one" means only one of the listed options, not more.
- "Not" negates the listed condition (the condition must be false).
