Imagine a library where each label is a little flag waving over a tale — each tells you exactly what to expect. I’ll walk you through those flags like characters in a story, keeping every rule of their relationships intact so you can use them to annotate and reason with confidence.

- [THEME-GROWTH]
  In this catalog, a story earns the flag [THEME-GROWTH] whenever it carries the theme Growth.

- [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  A tale bears the banner [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if its heart is about Helping Others.

- [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
  The label [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] is given to any story that opens with an adverb — that first word sets the scene and takes the lead.

- [STYLE-MODERN]
  When a story feels contemporary in voice or form, we mark it as [STYLE-MODERN].

- [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
  If a story is about seasonal changes, it receives the tag [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES].

- [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
  The label [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] belongs to stories that use the perfect aspect in their verb forms.

- [LOW-READABILITY]
  We call a story [LOW-READABILITY] when its readability score falls below 86.4.

- [STYLE-CLASSIC]
  A story is [STYLE-CLASSIC] if it aligns with a classic style.

- [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
  The tag [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES] is reserved for stories about mystical creatures.

- [HIGH-READABILITY]
  A story is [HIGH-READABILITY] when its readability score rises above 96.1.

Now meet the composite characters — labels that are born from combinations of those simpler traits. Their identities are strict; they follow precise rules. I’ll tell you the rules like plot twists, but I won’t change the logic.

- [SEASONAL-GROWTH]
  A story is [SEASONAL-GROWTH] if all of the following are true:
  - The story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
  - The story is [THEME-GROWTH]
  - The story is not [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
  Think of [SEASONAL-GROWTH] as a tale rooted in the rhythms of the seasons and centered on personal or natural growth — but explicitly excluding anything about mystical creatures.

- [COMPOSED-STORY]
  A story is [COMPOSED-STORY] if either of the following is true:
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [SEASONAL-GROWTH]
    - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - either of the following is true:
    - both of the following are true:
      - The story is [STYLE-MODERN]
      - The story is not [LOW-READABILITY]
    - both of the following are true:
      - The story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]
      - both of the following are true:
        - The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
        - The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]

Read this like a set of storytelling laws: a [COMPOSED-STORY] can arrive in one of three main ways — as a seasonal-growth tale that also helps others, or as a modern piece that remains readable, or as a classic whose perfected verbs and high readability make it shine. Each path follows the exact logical structure above; the relationships and node IDs remain unchanged so you can apply them directly in annotation and reasoning.
