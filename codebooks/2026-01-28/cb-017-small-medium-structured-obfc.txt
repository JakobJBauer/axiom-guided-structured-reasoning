- Preserve the exact node IDs in brackets when marking labels.
- Follow the logical operators as written:
  - "exactly one of the following is true" = exclusive OR between listed items.
  - "both of the following are true" = logical AND of listed items.
  - "Either of the following are true" = logical OR of listed items.
  - "not" negates the condition that follows.
- When evaluating [attr-1], apply the outer AND first, then evaluate the nested OR/AND structure exactly as presented.
