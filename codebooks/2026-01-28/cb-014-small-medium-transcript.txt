Interviewer: Okay, let's walk through this codebook together. First, what does [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] mean?

Annotator: Simple definition:
- A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] if the story starts with a adjective

Interviewer: Got it. And what about [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]?

Annotator: Also straightforward:
- A story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES] if the story is about giant creatures

Interviewer: Now we get into combinations. What is [GIANT-FOCUSED]?

Annotator: This one combines two conditions. The rule states:
- A story is [GIANT-FOCUSED] if both of the following are true:
  - The story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
  - The story is not [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]

Interviewer: So it must be about giant creatures and must not start with an adjective. Clear. Next: [DYNAMIC-OPENING] — what does that capture?

Annotator: [DYNAMIC-OPENING] describes an exclusive alternative between two possibilities. The exact wording is important:
- A story is [DYNAMIC-OPENING] if exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - The story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]

Interviewer: So for [DYNAMIC-OPENING], either it starts with an adjective or it’s about giant creatures — but not both. Right?

Annotator: Exactly.

Interviewer: Finally, tell me about [ENGAGING-GIANT-STORY]. That sounds like a compound rule.

Annotator: It is compound and layered. Here’s the precise definition:
- A story is [ENGAGING-GIANT-STORY] if both of the following are true:
  - The story is [GIANT-FOCUSED]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [DYNAMIC-OPENING]
    - The story is not [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]

Interviewer: So to be an [ENGAGING-GIANT-STORY], the story must first be [GIANT-FOCUSED] (which we already know requires [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES] and not [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]). Then, additionally, either it has a [DYNAMIC-OPENING] or it is not [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]. Understood.

Annotator: Right — all the logical relationships (Not, both/and, exactly one, either/or) are kept exactly as written. If you want, I can run through a couple of quick examples to see how a story would be labeled under these rules.
