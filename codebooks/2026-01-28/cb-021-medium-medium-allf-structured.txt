Structured Codebook — concise, clear, and ready for annotation

Overview
- Purpose: Provide a clear, hierarchical reference for annotators. Each node is defined precisely. Logical relationships (And, Or, Exactly one, Both, equality, Not) are preserved exactly as in the original codebook.
- Usage: For each story, evaluate the atomic properties first, then evaluate composite nodes using the stated logical criteria.

Atomic (basic) labels
- [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] if the story starts with an adjective.

- [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] if the story starts with a noun.

- [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] if the story is lighthearted.

- [STYLE-SURREAL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-SURREAL] if the story is surreal.

- [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS] if the story is humorous.

- [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] if the story has the theme Problem-Solving.

- [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception.

Composite (derived) labels — logical constructions
- [START-TYPE-XOR]
  - Meaning: Exclusive start-type.
  - Rule: A story is [START-TYPE-XOR] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]

- [TONE-PLAYFUL]
  - Meaning: Playful tone (derived from style or combination of style + theme absence).
  - Rule: A story is [TONE-PLAYFUL] if either of the following is true:
    - The story's style is in the set { [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED], [STYLE-HUMOROUS] }
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [STYLE-SURREAL]
      - The story is not [THEME-DECEPTION]

- [DECEPTION-OR-PROBLEM]
  - Meaning: Presence of either deception or problem-solving theme.
  - Rule: A story is [DECEPTION-OR-PROBLEM] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
    - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]

- [STYLE-EQUALITY]
  - Meaning: Style equality constraint.
  - Rule: A story is [STYLE-EQUALITY] if the following equality holds:
    - [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] = [STYLE-HUMOROUS]

- [COMPLEX-STORY]
  - Meaning: Complex story indicator combining start-type exclusivity with a single tonal/theme condition.
  - Rule: A story is [COMPLEX-STORY] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [START-TYPE-XOR]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [TONE-PLAYFUL]
      - The story is [DECEPTION-OR-PROBLEM]

Quick annotator checklist (practical ordering)
1. Determine atomic labels first:
   - Check start token: assign [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] or [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] as applicable.
   - Assign style labels: [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED], [STYLE-SURREAL], [STYLE-HUMOROUS] as appropriate.
   - Assign theme labels: [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING], [THEME-DECEPTION] if present.
2. Evaluate composite labels in the given sequence:
   - [START-TYPE-XOR] (check exclusive-start condition)
   - [TONE-PLAYFUL] (use style set membership or the SURR real + not DECEPTION branch)
   - [DECEPTION-OR-PROBLEM] (either theme)
   - [STYLE-EQUALITY] (verify equality)
   - [COMPLEX-STORY] (requires both [START-TYPE-XOR] and exactly-one of [TONE-PLAYFUL] / [DECEPTION-OR-PROBLEM])

Notes and tips
- Preserve exact logical operators when reasoning: "exactly one" implies exclusivity; "either" allows one or the other (or both) only when explicitly used; "Both" requires both subconditions to be true.
- When a composite condition references an atomic node (e.g., [STYLE-SURREAL]), use your atomic annotations as the source of truth.
- Do not add or remove nodes; use these definitions strictly to maintain consistency across annotations.
