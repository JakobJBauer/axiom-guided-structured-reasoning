[attr-3]
Think of [attr-3] as a simple label for stories that carry a light, breezy tone — the kind that makes you smile rather than sigh. A story is [attr-3] if the story is lighthearted.

[attr-2]
When a tale opens with an adverb — "Suddenly," "Happily," "Reluctantly," and the like — we tag it as [attr-2]. A story is [attr-2] if the story starts with a adverb.

[attr-1]
If a piece stretches beyond a modest length — more than 375 words — we call it [attr-1]. A story is [attr-1] if the story has more than 375 words.

[attr-4]
Stories that center on humor, where comedy is the driving theme, get the [attr-4] label. A story is [attr-4] if the story has the theme Humor.

[attr-5]
When the subject matter drifts back in time to old-fashioned days and bygone eras, we use [attr-5]. A story is [attr-5] if the story is about bygone eras.

[attr-6]
We reserve [attr-6] for stories that combine a sunny tone with comedic intent, especially when they nod to the past or open with a playful adverb. Formally, a story is [attr-6] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-3]
- The story is [attr-4] and either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-5]
  - The story is [attr-2]
