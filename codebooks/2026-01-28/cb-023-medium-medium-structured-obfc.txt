Purpose
- This codebook defines labels (nodes) used to classify stories.
- Each label is given a clear condition. Composite labels combine simpler labels using logical operations (And, Or, Not).
- Keep this sheet nearby while annotating so you can apply labels consistently.

I. Atomic (single-condition) labels
- [attr-10]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-10] if the story is philosophical.

- [attr-12]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-12] if the story is about the arts.

- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if the story has a flashback.

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if the story has a story within a story.

- [attr-11]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-11] if the story has the theme Deception.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if the story has a Red Herring.

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the story has a moral lesson.

II. Composite (logical) labels — structure and conditions
- [attr-9]
  - Logic: AND relationship
  - A story is [attr-9] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-10]
    - The story is [attr-12]

- [attr-7]
  - Logic: OR relationship
  - A story is [attr-7] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-3]
    - The story is [attr-6]

- [attr-8]
  - Logic: AND relationship
  - A story is [attr-8] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-11]
    - The story is [attr-5]

- [attr-2]
  - Logic: AND with a NOT condition
  - A story is [attr-2] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-8]
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story is not [attr-9]

- [attr-1]
  - Logic: AND relationship between composite labels
  - A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-2]
    - The story is [attr-7]

Quick annotation checklist (use with each story)
- Identify atomic properties first:
  - Is it philosophical? → [attr-10]
  - Is it about the arts? → [attr-12]
  - Any flashbacks? → [attr-3]
  - Any story-within? → [attr-6]
  - Does deception drive the theme? → [attr-11]
  - Is there a red herring? → [attr-5]
  - Is there an explicit moral lesson? → [attr-4]
- Then derive composite labels using the logical rules above:
  - Apply AND / OR / NOT exactly as specified for each composite node.

Notes on logical integrity
- Do not alter node IDs or the logical relationships shown.
- Composite labels depend strictly on the listed conditions (including negation for [attr-2]).
- Use this structured view to reason step-by-step from atomic facts to higher-level labels.
