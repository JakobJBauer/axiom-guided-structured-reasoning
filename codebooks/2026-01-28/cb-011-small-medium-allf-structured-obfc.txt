Codebook — Structured View
Purpose: Provide a clear, hierarchical representation of each annotation node and its logical relationships. Use this as a checklist when deciding whether a story satisfies a node.

1) Atomic nodes — basic labels
- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if the story is about the arts.

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if the story uses conditional mood.

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the story starts with a adjective.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if the story is philosophical.

2) Compound nodes — logical combinations
- [attr-3]
  - Qualification rule: A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-7]
    - The story is not [attr-4]

- [attr-1]
  - Qualification rule: A story is [attr-1] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-6]
    - The story is [attr-5]

- [attr-2]
  - Qualification rule: A story is [attr-2] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-3]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is in the set of topics that includes [attr-6]
      - The truth of [attr-5] is equal to the truth of not [attr-7]

3) Quick annotation checklist (how to decide)
- First, identify atomic properties:
  - Is the story about the arts? → [attr-6]
  - Does the story use conditional mood? → [attr-7]
  - Does the story start with an adjective? → [attr-4]
  - Is the story philosophical in style? → [attr-5]

- Then evaluate compounds in order:
  - If the story both uses conditional mood and does not start with an adjective → tag [attr-3].
  - If exactly one of “about the arts” or “philosophical” holds → tag [attr-1].
  - For [attr-2], mark true if:
    - the story meets [attr-3], OR
    - both (it is within the topics that include [attr-6]) AND (STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL’s truth equals the truth of not [attr-7]).

Notes and reminders
- All logical relationships must be preserved exactly as listed above (Not, And, Or / both, exactly one, either).
- Do not alter node IDs — use the bracketed IDs verbatim when annotating.
- The phrase “the story is in the set of topics that includes [attr-6]” is intentional: treat it as checking topic membership that covers [attr-6].
