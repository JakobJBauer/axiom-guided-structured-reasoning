**Interviewer:** We’re going to annotate stories using a few nodes. Can you start by telling me what **[attr-4]** means?

**Annotator:** Sure. A story is **[attr-4]** if the story has the theme *Helping Others*.

---

**Interviewer:** Got it. What about **[attr-5]**—when do we apply that?

**Annotator:** A story is **[attr-5]** if the story is about mystical creatures.

---

**Interviewer:** And there’s one about how the story begins, right? **[attr-3]**?

**Annotator:** Exactly. A story is **[attr-3]** if the story starts with a preposition.

---

**Interviewer:** Now it looks like we start combining things. Can you explain **[attr-2]**?

**Annotator:** Yes—this one is a two-part test, and **both** parts have to be true. A story is **[attr-2]** if both of the following are true:  
- The story is **[attr-5]**  
- The story is **not [attr-4]**

**Interviewer:** So it’s mystical creatures *and* explicitly not a helping-others theme.

**Annotator:** Right—**And** plus a **Not**.

---

**Interviewer:** Last one: **[attr-1]**. This sounds like it’s also built from other nodes?

**Annotator:** It is. A story is **[attr-1]** if both of the following are true:  
- The story is **[attr-3]**  
- The story is **not [attr-2]**

**Interviewer:** So it starts with a preposition, and it must *not* fall into that “mystical but not helping others” category.

**Annotator:** Exactly—again, **both** conditions must hold: **And** with a **Not** applied to **[attr-2]**.
