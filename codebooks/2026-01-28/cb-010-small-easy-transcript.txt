Interviewer: Now the important composite node — tell me how [CULTURAL-INNOVATION-QUESTIONS] is defined.

Expert: Sure. Here's the exact logical definition you should use:

[CULTURAL-INNOVATION-QUESTIONS]
A story is [CULTURAL-INNOVATION-QUESTIONS] if all of the following are true:

- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
  - The story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
- The story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]

Interviewer: So to confirm, a story must have the Innovation theme, must be either about cultural traditions or bygone eras, and must use wh-questions — all three together — to be marked as [CULTURAL-INNOVATION-QUESTIONS]?

Expert: Exactly. All those conditions together form the label [CULTURAL-INNOVATION-QUESTIONS].
