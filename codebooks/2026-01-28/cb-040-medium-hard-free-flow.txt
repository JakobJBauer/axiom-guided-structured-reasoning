Think of this as a friendly guide to the tagging rules — written like a conversation, but precise enough for annotation and reasoning. I’ll keep every node ID exactly as it appears, and I won’t change any logical tests or relationships. Here’s the same codebook, made easier to read.

[THEME-AGENCY]
We mark a story as [THEME-AGENCY] when the story carries the theme Agency.

[STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
We call a story [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] when the story begins with a noun.

That’s it — the same logic, just presented with a bit more conversational flow so it’s easier to read while you annotate.
