Structured codebook — clear, hierarchical definitions for annotators

Purpose
- Provide a compact, organized reference for annotating these story-level labels.
- Preserve exact node IDs and logical relationships; do not change any IDs, operations, or formulas.
- Use this as a decision checklist when assigning labels.

Core node definitions
- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-2] if the story has a flashback.
  - Annotator note: Mark this whenever a portion of the narrative explicitly returns to an earlier time or event.

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if the story uses wh-questions.
  - Annotator note: Look for questions beginning with who, what, when, where, why, how, etc.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if the story uses discourse markers.
  - Annotator note: Identify explicit connective/organizational words or phrases (e.g., however, then, meanwhile, on the other hand).

Compound and derived labels (logical rules)
- [attr-3]
  - Rule: A story is [attr-3] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-6]
    - The story is [attr-5]
  - Interpretation: Apply [attr-3] only when one of those two source labels is present and the other is absent (this is an exclusive-or condition).

- [attr-1]
  - Rule: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-2]
    - The story is not [attr-3]
  - Interpretation: Mark [attr-1] when a flashback occurs and the story does not meet the exclusive-interactive condition above.

- [attr-4]
  - Rule: A story is [attr-4] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is in the set { [attr-3], [attr-1] }
    - The story is equal to [attr-2]
  - Interpretation: [attr-4] applies when any of these hold:
    - The story is labeled [attr-3], or
    - The story is labeled [attr-1], or
    - The story is labeled [attr-2].
  - Note: Because [attr-2] alone implies [attr-4] (by the final disjunct), any flashback automatically meets [attr-4], and being [attr-3] or [attr-1] also triggers it.

Quick decision checklist (step-by-step)
1. Does the story have a flashback?
   - If yes → assign [attr-2].
2. Does the story use wh-questions?
   - If yes → assign [attr-6].
3. Does the story use discourse markers?
   - If yes → assign [attr-5].
4. Determine [attr-3]:
   - Assign [attr-3] if exactly one of [attr-6] or [attr-5] is true.
5. Determine [attr-1]:
   - Assign [attr-1] if [attr-2] is true AND [attr-3] is not true.
6. Determine [attr-4]:
   - Assign [attr-4] if any of: [attr-3], [attr-1], or [attr-2] is true.

Final reminders for annotators
- Do not alter any node IDs or logical operators.
- Follow the exact logical rules above; the compound nodes depend on the primitive labels.
- Use the quick checklist to ensure consistent, reproducible labeling.
