Imagine a curious librarian who catalogs stories not by shelf number but by the qualities that make each tale sparkle. She whispers each label like a charm, and the labels — our nodes — stick to a story when it meets the precise criteria below. Read them as signposts in a living map; the logic is strict, but the path is meant to be read like a tale.

[SHORT-STORY]
Think of a tiny fable told over a single breath: a story becomes [SHORT-STORY] when it fits into fewer than 160 words.

[THEME-KINDNESS]
When kindness is the heart beating beneath the plot, the tale wears the badge [THEME-KINDNESS].

[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
If the plot or characters turn their hands toward aiding another, the tale is called [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS].

[THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
When the story revolves around puzzles, obstacles, and the clever means to overcome them, it is labeled [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING].

[STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
A tale that leans into big questions, reflection, and contemplative tones earns the title [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL].

[HIGH-READABILITY]
Some stories glide effortlessly off the page; those with a readability score above 96.1 are marked [HIGH-READABILITY].

[STYLE-PLAYFUL]
If the narrative skips along with a light, mischievous step, it is [STYLE-PLAYFUL].

[THEME-HUMOR]
When humor threads the theme and drives the story’s meaning, the label is [THEME-HUMOR].

[STYLE-HUMOROUS]
A story that uses wit and comedic style to shape its voice is [STYLE-HUMOROUS].

[HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
Sometimes a tale tells another tale inside it; when it does, it is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY].

[TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
If mystical creatures populate the narrative — dragons, fae, or other enchanted beings — the story falls under [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES].

[HAS-A-RED-HERRING]
When the tale plants a misleading clue to divert the reader, it carries the mark [HAS-A-RED-HERRING].

Now the librarian points to combinations where labels must occur together, like constellations aligning.

[KINDNESS-HELPING]
A story is [KINDNESS-HELPING] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
- The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
(And both must hold simultaneously.)

[LIGHT-HEARTED]
A story is [LIGHT-HEARTED] if exactly one of the following is true (Xor):
- The story is [STYLE-PLAYFUL]
- The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]

[THEME-IN-CORE-SET]
The librarian keeps a core set of three themes. A story is [THEME-IN-CORE-SET] if the story's dominant theme is In the following set:
- [THEME-KINDNESS], [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS], [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
(Use In to check membership among those theme nodes.)

[BALANCED-TONE]
She loves balance. A story is [BALANCED-TONE] if the following Equal relationship holds:
- The presence of [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] Equal the presence of [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
(They are Equal when either both are present or both are absent.)

[MYSTICAL-ALLEGORY]
Some tales are layered like a painted shell. A story is [MYSTICAL-ALLEGORY] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
- The story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY] And the story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
(This nests an And inside an And to form an allegorical structure.)

[COMPLEX-ARC]
Here the librarian’s rulebook gets intricate. A story is [COMPLEX-ARC] if all of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true (Or):
  - The story is [KINDNESS-HELPING]
  - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
- Exactly one of the following is true (Xor):
  - The story is [HAS-A-RED-HERRING]
  - The story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
- The story is Not [SHORT-STORY] Or the story is [HIGH-READABILITY]
(Uses Not to exclude short stories unless they also meet HIGH-READABILITY; combines Or and Xor for nuanced arc structure.)

[RECOMMENDABLE-COMPOSITION]
Finally, the librarian sets aside the rarest scrolls as truly recommendable. A story is [RECOMMENDABLE-COMPOSITION] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [COMPLEX-ARC] And the story is [BALANCED-TONE]
- The story is [THEME-IN-CORE-SET] And either of the following is true (Or):
  - The story is [LIGHT-HEARTED]
  - The story is [MYSTICAL-ALLEGORY]
(This node nests multiple logical operators to form a deep, recommendable composition: And at the top level, Or inside a branch, and references In, Equal, Not, and Xor through its subordinate nodes.)

Read these labels as the librarian does: as both rules and invitations. Each node is a description and a doorway — strict in logic, generous in storytelling — guiding annotators and thinkers through a world where meaning is precise and every story can be placed on the map.
