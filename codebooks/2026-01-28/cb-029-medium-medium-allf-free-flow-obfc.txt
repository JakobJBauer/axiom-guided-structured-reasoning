Think of this as a friendly guide to the tags we use — each label is short, but its meaning is precise. Below you'll find each node and a smooth explanation of when to apply it, written in a natural voice while keeping all the logical rules exactly as they are.

[attr-8]
A story is [attr-8] if the story is philosophical.

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if the story has a story within a story.

[attr-12]
A story is [attr-12] if the story uses conditional mood.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if the story has circular narrative structure.

[attr-10]
A story is [attr-10] if the story is about cultural traditions.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if the story has fewer than 160 words.

[attr-11]
A story is [attr-11] if the story is about seasonal changes.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if the story has readability score below 86.4.

[attr-4]
When a piece contains a nested tale and that inner tale speaks in hypotheticals, we give it this label. Formally:
A story is [attr-4] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-2]
- The story is [attr-12]

[attr-6]
This tag catches a precise intersection: it wants either the philosophical tone or the circular shape — but not both — and it also insists that shortness and low readability line up. In plain terms:
A story is [attr-6] if both of the following are true:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-8]
  - The story is [attr-3]
- The truth value of the following are equal:
  - [attr-7]
  - [attr-5]

[attr-9]
We group stories under this tag when their subject fits one of a couple of related themes. Precisely:
A story is [attr-9] if the story's topic is in the set:
- [attr-10]
- [attr-11]

[attr-1]
This is the label for pieces that combine structural complexity with a clear topical focus and enough length to matter. In other words:
A story is [attr-1] if all of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is [attr-6]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-9]
  - The story is not [attr-7]

That’s the full set — same logical relationships, just laid out in an easier-to-read, conversational way so you can apply the tags confidently.
