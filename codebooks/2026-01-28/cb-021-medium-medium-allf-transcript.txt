Interviewer: Let’s go through this codebook together. First, can you define the basic surface-level labels?

Expert: Sure.

- Question: What does [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] mean?
  - Answer: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] if the story starts with a adjective.

- Question: And what about [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]?
  - Answer: A story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] if the story starts with a noun.

- Question: How do you label tone or style at a simple level?
  - Answer: 
    - A story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] if the story is lighthearted.
    - A story is [STYLE-SURREAL] if the story is surreal.
    - A story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS] if the story is humorous.

Interviewer: Good. What about thematic labels?

Expert:
- Question: What does [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] mean?
  - Answer: A story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] if the story has the theme Problem-Solving.

- Question: And [THEME-DECEPTION]?
  - Answer: A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception.

Interviewer: Now for the composite or logical nodes — how are those specified?

Expert:
- Question: How is [START-TYPE-XOR] defined?
  - Answer: A story is [START-TYPE-XOR] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]

- Question: How is [TONE-PLAYFUL] determined?
  - Answer: A story is [TONE-PLAYFUL] if either of the following is true:
    - The story's style is in the set { [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED], [STYLE-HUMOROUS] }
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [STYLE-SURREAL]
      - The story is not [THEME-DECEPTION]

Interviewer: That “not” is important — it's part of the logical structure.

Expert: Exactly. It’s an explicit negation in the second branch.

Interviewer: Continue—what’s next?

Expert:
- Question: What is [DECEPTION-OR-PROBLEM]?
  - Answer: A story is [DECEPTION-OR-PROBLEM] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
    - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]

- Question: There’s an equality test too. What does [STYLE-EQUALITY] mean?
  - Answer: A story is [STYLE-EQUALITY] if the following equality holds:
    - [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] = [STYLE-HUMOROUS]

Interviewer: So that last one checks whether those two style labels are equivalent for the story.

Expert: Correct.

Interviewer: And finally, the most complex node?

Expert:
- Question: How is [COMPLEX-STORY] defined?
  - Answer: A story is [COMPLEX-STORY] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [START-TYPE-XOR]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [TONE-PLAYFUL]
      - The story is [DECEPTION-OR-PROBLEM]

Interviewer: To confirm — that means [COMPLEX-STORY] requires the XOR start-type and then it requires that exactly one of the two higher-level conditions (playful tone vs deception-or-problem theme) holds.

Expert: Yes. The logical relationships and operators (Exactly one, either, both, and the negation) are all preserved as written. Each node and its ID remain unchanged; we’re just restating the same conditions in a conversational, question-and-answer format for clarity.
