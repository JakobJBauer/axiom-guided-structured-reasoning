Interviewer: Let’s walk through this codebook together. I’ll ask about each label and you answer. Sound good?

Expert: Sounds great. I’ll keep the exact definitions and logical structure as written.

Interviewer: First up, what is [SHORT-STORY]?

Expert: A story is [SHORT-STORY] if the story has fewer than 160 words.

Interviewer: Clear. And [THEME-MAGIC]?

Expert: A story is [THEME-MAGIC] if the story has the theme Magic.

Interviewer: What about [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]?

Expert: A story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] if the story uses wh-questions.

Interviewer: I see. Explain [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN], please.

Expert: A story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN] if the story has Checkhov's gun.

Interviewer: And [HIGH-READABILITY]?

Expert: A story is [HIGH-READABILITY] if the story has readability score above 96.1.

Interviewer: Now we get to the composite labels. How is [MYSTERIOUS-MAGIC] defined?

Expert: [MYSTERIOUS-MAGIC] is true when both of the following are true:
- The story is [THEME-MAGIC]
- The story is not [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]

Interviewer: So it requires the Magic theme and the absence of Checkhov’s gun. Got it. Next: [TIGHT-MAGIC-CRAFT] — that sounds more complex.

Expert: It is a bit layered. A story is [TIGHT-MAGIC-CRAFT] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [SHORT-STORY]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [MYSTERIOUS-MAGIC]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is not [HIGH-READABILITY]
    - The story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]

Interviewer: Let me check I’ve got that right. For [TIGHT-MAGIC-CRAFT], first it must be a short story. Then either it qualifies as [MYSTERIOUS-MAGIC], or, if it doesn’t, exactly one of those two alternatives must hold: either it lacks [HIGH-READABILITY], or it uses [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]. Correct?

Expert: Exactly. The logical relationships — both, either, and exactly one — are preserved just as in the original definitions.

Interviewer: Great. That covers every node, and the logical structure is intact. Anything else to note?

Expert: Just that every node ID — like [SHORT-STORY], [THEME-MAGIC], [MYSTERIOUS-MAGIC], etc. — is used exactly as given, and no nodes or logical operators were added, removed, or changed. This transcript simply explains the same logic in a conversational Q&A format to make it easier to read and apply during annotation.
