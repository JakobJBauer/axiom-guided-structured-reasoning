Imagine a curious librarian who catalogs stories not by shelf number but by the qualities that make each tale sparkle. She whispers each label like a charm, and the labels — our nodes — stick to a story when it meets the precise criteria below. Read them as signposts in a living map; the logic is strict, but the path is meant to be read like a tale.

[attr-10]
Think of a tiny fable told over a single breath: a story becomes [attr-10] when it fits into fewer than 160 words.

[attr-17]
When kindness is the heart beating beneath the plot, the tale wears the badge [attr-17].

[attr-14]
If the plot or characters turn their hands toward aiding another, the tale is called [attr-14].

[attr-18]
When the story revolves around puzzles, obstacles, and the clever means to overcome them, it is labeled [attr-18].

[attr-12]
A tale that leans into big questions, reflection, and contemplative tones earns the title [attr-12].

[attr-5]
Some stories glide effortlessly off the page; those with a readability score above 96.1 are marked [attr-5].

[attr-13]
If the narrative skips along with a light, mischievous step, it is [attr-13].

[attr-15]
When humor threads the theme and drives the story’s meaning, the label is [attr-15].

[attr-11]
A story that uses wit and comedic style to shape its voice is [attr-11].

[attr-4]
Sometimes a tale tells another tale inside it; when it does, it is [attr-4].

[attr-19]
If mystical creatures populate the narrative — dragons, fae, or other enchanted beings — the story falls under [attr-19].

[attr-3]
When the tale plants a misleading clue to divert the reader, it carries the mark [attr-3].

Now the librarian points to combinations where labels must occur together, like constellations aligning.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-17]
- The story is [attr-14]
(And both must hold simultaneously.)

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if exactly one of the following is true (Xor):
- The story is [attr-13]
- The story is [attr-11]

[attr-16]
The librarian keeps a core set of three themes. A story is [attr-16] if the story's dominant theme is In the following set:
- [attr-17], [attr-14], [attr-18]
(Use In to check membership among those theme nodes.)

[attr-1]
She loves balance. A story is [attr-1] if the following Equal relationship holds:
- The presence of [attr-12] Equal the presence of [attr-11]
(They are Equal when either both are present or both are absent.)

[attr-8]
Some tales are layered like a painted shell. A story is [attr-8] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-19]
- The story is [attr-4] And the story is [attr-12]
(This nests an And inside an And to form an allegorical structure.)

[attr-2]
Here the librarian’s rulebook gets intricate. A story is [attr-2] if all of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true (Or):
  - The story is [attr-6]
  - The story is [attr-18]
- Exactly one of the following is true (Xor):
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - The story is [attr-4]
- The story is Not [attr-10] Or the story is [attr-5]
(Uses Not to exclude short stories unless they also meet HIGH-READABILITY; combines Or and Xor for nuanced arc structure.)

[attr-9]
Finally, the librarian sets aside the rarest scrolls as truly recommendable. A story is [attr-9] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-2] And the story is [attr-1]
- The story is [attr-16] And either of the following is true (Or):
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-8]
(This node nests multiple logical operators to form a deep, recommendable composition: And at the top level, Or inside a branch, and references In, Equal, Not, and Xor through its subordinate nodes.)

Read these labels as the librarian does: as both rules and invitations. Each node is a description and a doorway — strict in logic, generous in storytelling — guiding annotators and thinkers through a world where meaning is precise and every story can be placed on the map.
