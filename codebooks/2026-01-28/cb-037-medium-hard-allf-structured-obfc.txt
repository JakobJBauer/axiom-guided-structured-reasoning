Codebook — Structured Reference

Purpose: Provide clear, hierarchical definitions for each annotation node. Each entry states the exact logical condition(s) that make a story qualify for that node. All node IDs, logical operators, and relationships are preserved exactly as written.

Basic (atomic) nodes
- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if the story has a story within a story.

- [attr-11]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-11] if the story has the theme Magic.

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if the story has a flashback.

- [attr-12]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-12] if the story is about the arts.

- [attr-10]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-10] if the story is minimalist.

- [attr-8]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if the story has circular narrative structure.

Device / relation nodes (logical comparisons between devices)
- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-7]
    - The story is [attr-6]
  - (Interpretation: exclusive OR — one and only one of those device nodes applies.)

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the truth value of [attr-7] equals the truth value of [attr-8].
  - (Interpretation: both are true or both are false.)

Set-membership / theme combination
- [attr-9]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-9] if the story's primary theme or topic is in the set {[attr-11], [attr-12]}.
  - (Interpretation: primary theme/topic is either Magic or The Arts.)

Composite narrative nodes (combined logical requirements)
- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
    1. Either of the following are true:
       - The story is [attr-5]
       - The story is [attr-4]
    2. The story is not [attr-10] and (the story is [attr-8] or the story is [attr-6])
  - (Interpretation: one of the device relations must hold, and the story must be non-minimalist while also having a circular structure or a flashback.)

- [attr-1]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [attr-9]
    2. Either of the following are true:
       - The story is [attr-3]
       - The story is [attr-10]
  - (Interpretation: primary theme/topic is Magic or The Arts, and the story is either complex by the core definition or deliberately minimalist.)

Final composite node (exact exclusivity)
- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [attr-1]
    2. Exactly one of the following is true:
       - The story is [attr-4]
       - The story is not [attr-6]
  - (Interpretation: must be an ART-MAGIC-NARRATIVE and satisfy an exclusive condition between [attr-4] and the negation of [attr-6].)

Notes for annotators (practical reminders)
- Preserve exact node semantics when deciding truth values. Do not conflate similar-sounding concepts.
- When a node requires compound conditions, ensure each sub-condition is evaluated individually and combined according to the specified logic (And / Or / Exactly one / Not / Equal).
- For set-membership [attr-9], treat the story’s primary theme or topic as the determining factor.
- For [attr-4], check equality of truth values (both true or both false) — not structural similarity.
