Codebook — Structured Reference for Annotation

Purpose
- This document defines the node labels and their logical composition for story annotation.
- Each entry states the precise condition under which a story should be considered as having a given node.
- All node IDs are preserved exactly in [attr-1] format and all logical relationships (both/and, either/or, xor, not, exactly one, etc.) are preserved as written.

       - The story is [attr-17] equals false

- [attr-2]
  - A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [attr-6]
    2. either of the following is true:
       - The story is [attr-20]
       - both of the following are true:

Usage notes (how to read this structure)
- "either of the following is true" denotes logical OR.
- "both of the following are true" denotes logical AND.
- "exactly one of the following is true" denotes exclusive OR (one true, one false).
- "xor" explicitly marks exclusive-or between two listed nodes.
- "not both of the following are true" forbids the simultaneous truth of both listed conditions.
- Preserve the literal phrasing where present (e.g., "The story is [attr-17] equals false") — these are intentional logical tests.
