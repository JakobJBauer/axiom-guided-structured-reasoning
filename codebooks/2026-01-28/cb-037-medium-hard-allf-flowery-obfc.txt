A prefatory whisper before the catalogue: imagine, if you will, a dusty salon of lantern light where scholars and storytellers have gathered to catalogue the secret taxonomy of tales. Each entry below is a labeled strand of that living tapestry. I shall dress the definitions in floral language and conjure a little myth behind the codex, but rest assured—the logical bones, the nodes in their exact [attr-2] forms, and the precise relations between them are untouched and intact. Read as both guide and incantation.

[attr-8]
A story is [attr-8] if The story has a story within a story.
- In plain terms and in poetic echo: the tale cradles another tale within its heart — a narrative like a song within a song, a smaller world tucked into the folds of the larger one.

[attr-12]
A story is [attr-12] if The story has the theme Magic.
- Rendered in richer language: the narrative’s dominant pulse is the wondrous and the uncanny; sorcery, enchantment, or the marvelous form its central theme.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if The story has a flashback.
- Said with color: the plot bends backward through memory — scenes that turn their gaze to earlier moments, summoning the past into the present action.

[attr-13]
A story is [attr-13] if The story is about the arts.
- Ornamented explanation: the tale’s subject is the realm of art — painters, musicians, sculptors, performance — the craft and culture of artistic creation.

[attr-11]
A story is [attr-11] if The story is minimalist.
- Flowery restatement: the voice favors deliberate simplicity and restraint, a pared-down aesthetic where every word is counted and nothing extraneous intrudes.

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] if The story has circular narrative structure.
- In lyrical terms: the plot comes full circle, orbiting back to its beginning in a ringlike motion, forming a structural helix that returns the reader to the start.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-8]
- The story is [attr-7]
- Interpretation embroidered: [attr-6] marks the exquisite exclusivity of devices — either an inner tale blooms within the main tale, or the narrative reveries of a flashback visit, but never both at once; precisely one of those devices holds true.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if the truth value of [attr-8] equals the truth value of [attr-9]
- In poetic clarity: [attr-5] denotes a parity of form — either both the nested-story device and the ringed circular structure are present together, or neither is; their truth values march in step, equal as twin stars.

[attr-10]
A story is [attr-10] if the story's primary theme or topic is in the set {[attr-12], [attr-13]}
- Flowery explication: this membership invites tales whose core belongs to the fellowship of the magical and the artistic — if its principal identity is either enchantment or artistry, it joins this set.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-6]
  - The story is [attr-5]
- The story is not [attr-11] and (the story is [attr-9] or the story is [attr-7])
- Blossomed reading: to be in the [attr-4] is to be a richly woven specimen — first, it must satisfy one of the device conditions (either the exclusive device choice of [attr-6] or the parity condition [attr-5]); and second, it must refuse the austerity of minimalism while embracing cyclical architecture or the backward-turning echo of a flashback. Both of these broad requirements must hold.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-10]
- Either of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is [attr-11]
- Enchanted elucidation: an [attr-1] lives where motif and method meet — its soul is magical or artistic, and it is either elaborately complex by structural measures or deliberately spare in style. Either condition suffices in concert with the membership.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-1]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-5]
  - The story is not [attr-7]
- Final poetic note: to be crowned a [attr-3] the tale must first be an [attr-1], and then it must satisfy an exclusive choice: either it stands in the mirrored relation of [attr-5], or alternatively it stands free of flashback; precisely one of these holds, no more, no less.

Thus ends the codex’s garden-walk: each entry retains its logical scaffolding, but now blooms with description and story. Use these definitions as you would botanical keys — to identify, to classify, and to celebrate the many forms a story may take.
