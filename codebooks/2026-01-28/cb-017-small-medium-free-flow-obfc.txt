Think of this as the same precise codebook, just spoken in a more natural, easygoing way. Every node ID remains exactly as written in brackets, and every logical condition, operator, and relationship stays intact — I’ve only added brief, friendly clarifications so the intent reads smoothly.

[attr-3]
A story is STYLE-HUMOROUS if The story is humorous
- In plain language: use this tag for stories that aim to be funny or that rely on humor as a defining trait.

[attr-4]
A story is STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED if The story is lighthearted
- This marks stories with a gentle, upbeat tone — the kind that feels breezy or easygoing rather than heavy.

[attr-5]
A story is THEME-KINDNESS if The story has the theme Kindness
- Simple and direct: this flags stories where kindness is a clear thematic element.

[attr-2]
A story is STYLE-EXCLUSIVE if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-3]
- The story is [attr-4]
- That is, STYLE-EXCLUSIVE applies when a story is one of those styles but not both — exactly one must hold.

[attr-1]
A story is GENRE-GENTLE if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- Either of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-2]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story is not [attr-3]
- In everyday terms: GENRE-GENTLE requires kindness as a theme, plus either (a) the story is exclusively humorous or lighthearted, or (b) it is lighthearted while explicitly not being humorous. This keeps the logic intact while clarifying when we call a story “gentle.”
