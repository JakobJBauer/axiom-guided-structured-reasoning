Notes on usage: Each bracketed identifier denotes a boolean predicate over story instances. Composite predicates are specified using standard logical composition: conjunctions ("both"/"all of the following are true"), disjunctions ("either of the following is true"), negation ("not"), and exclusive disjunction ("exactly one of the following is true"). Apply these rules deterministically during annotation and automated reasoning.
