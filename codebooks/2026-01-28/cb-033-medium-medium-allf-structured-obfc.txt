Codebook — Structured View

Overview
- Purpose: Present each labeling rule clearly and hierarchically so annotators can reason about labels step by step.
- Note: All node IDs are shown exactly in [attr-1] format and logical constructions (Not, And, Or, Exactly one, Both, Either) are preserved verbatim.

Atomic (single-condition) labels
- [attr-10]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-10] if The story has the theme Humor

- [attr-12]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-12] if The story is about lost civilizations

- [attr-8]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if The story is playful

- [attr-9]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-9] if The story is surreal

- [attr-13]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-13] if The story uses discourse markers

- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if The story has readability score below 86.4

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if The story is classic

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if The story is philosophical

- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-2] if The story has a cliffhanger

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if The story starts with a preposition

Composite labels (logical combinations)
- [attr-11]
  - Primary statement: A story is [attr-11] if either of the following is true:
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-8]
      - The story is [attr-7]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-9]
      - The story is not [attr-6]
  - How to evaluate:
    - First check exclusive choice: is exactly one of [attr-8] or [attr-7] present?
    - If not, check the conjunction: is the story [attr-9] and at the same time not [attr-6]?
    - If either block is satisfied, label [attr-11].

- [attr-4]
  - Primary statement: A story is [attr-4] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is in the following set:
      - [attr-10]
      - [attr-12]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-2]
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is equal to [attr-10]
        - The story is not [attr-3]
    - Or the story is [attr-11]
  - How to evaluate (stepwise):
    - Step 1 (required): Confirm the story belongs to the set listed (either [attr-10] or [attr-12]).
    - Step 2 (required): Verify that at least one of the following holds:
      - The story is [attr-2], or
      - Both of: the story is equal to [attr-10] and the story is not [attr-3], or
      - The story is [attr-11].
    - If both Step 1 and Step 2 are true, assign [attr-4].

Quick reference / decision hints
- Treat each atomic label as a single, directly observable property.
- For [attr-11], remember the “either” structure: it accepts either an exclusive playful/philosophical signal, or a surreal-but-not-classic combination.
- For [attr-4], both the set-membership condition and the secondary condition must hold; the secondary condition itself allows multiple alternative paths (cliffhanger; humor with acceptable readability; or tone mix).

End notes
- No node IDs or logical relationships have been changed.
- The structure is intended to guide annotators through a clear evaluation order: check atomic labels first, then composite rules using the preserved logical operators.
