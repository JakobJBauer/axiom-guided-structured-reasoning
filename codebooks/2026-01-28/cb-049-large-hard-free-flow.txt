Here’s the same codebook, rewritten to read like a friendly guide rather than a dry list — but don’t worry: every single node ID, logical test, and relationship stays exactly as it was. I’ve kept the logical connectors (either / both / exactly one / not) intact so you can use this for annotation and reasoning without ambiguity.

[HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
We mark a story [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] when it contains a cliffhanger — plain and simple: the story has a cliffhanger.

[STYLE-MODERN]
Use the label [STYLE-MODERN] when the story feels modern. If the story is modern, it gets [STYLE-MODERN].

[USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
A story earns [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if it uses discourse markers — those little words and phrases that stitch sentences and thoughts together.

[HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
Tag a story [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] when it includes a flashback. If it has a flashback, it is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK].

[THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
If the story’s theme centers on problem-solving, then it’s [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]. That’s the criterion.

[STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
When the very beginning of the story opens with an adjective, label it [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]. In short: the story starts with an adjective → [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE].

[USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
If the story uses wh-questions (who, what, where, when, why, how), it qualifies as [USES-WH-QUESTIONS].

[HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
A story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] if it contains juxtaposition — contrasting elements placed side by side.

[STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
If the story opens with an adverb, it should be tagged [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB].

[THEME-HUMOR]
When humor is a central theme, the story is [THEME-HUMOR].

[LOW-READABILITY]
We call a story [LOW-READABILITY] when its readability score falls below 86.4.

[STYLE-HUMOROUS]
If the story’s style is humorous, tag it [STYLE-HUMOROUS].

[STYLE-MINIMALIST]
Label a story [STYLE-MINIMALIST] when it follows a minimalist style.

[STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
A story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] when its tone is lighthearted.

[HIGH-READABILITY]
If the story’s readability score is above 96.1, it’s [HIGH-READABILITY].

[THEME-DECEPTION]
Tag [THEME-DECEPTION] when deception is a theme of the story.

[STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
If the story’s style is philosophical, use [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL].

[STRUCTURAL-DEVICES]
A story is [STRUCTURAL-DEVICES] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
  - The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
  - The story is not [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]

Think of [STRUCTURAL-DEVICES] as a catch-all for certain structural tricks: a cliffhanger qualifies outright; alternatively, a single occurrence of flashback or juxtaposition qualifies; and if discourse markers are present but there’s no cliffhanger, that combination also counts.

[OPENING-PATTERN]
A story is [OPENING-PATTERN] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
  - The story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]

So for an [OPENING-PATTERN] you need an opening word that’s an adjective or adverb, and then exactly one of two conversational choices in the opening: wh-questions or discourse markers — but not both.

[STYLE-TONE]
A story is [STYLE-TONE] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - The story is not [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
  - The story is not [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]

In other words, [STYLE-TONE] captures two modes: a modern, lighthearted story that isn’t minimalist, or a humorous story that isn’t philosophical.

[THEMATIC-CORE]
A story is [THEMATIC-CORE] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
  - The story is [THEME-HUMOR]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]

So [THEMATIC-CORE] is either the combination of problem-solving plus humor, or exactly one of deception vs. problem-solving — but not both.

[READABILITY-CLASS]
A story is [READABILITY-CLASS] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [LOW-READABILITY]
- The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]

Pick one: low or high readability — exactly one must hold for [READABILITY-CLASS].

[READABILITY-IMPACT]
A story is [READABILITY-IMPACT] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [READABILITY-CLASS]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - The story is not [LOW-READABILITY]

So [READABILITY-IMPACT] needs the story to be classified into a readability class, and then either it’s lighthearted or it simply isn’t low readability.

[ENGAGEMENT-PATTERN]
A story is [ENGAGEMENT-PATTERN] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STRUCTURAL-DEVICES]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [OPENING-PATTERN]
    - The story is not [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-TONE]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEMATIC-CORE]
    - The story is not [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]

Picture [ENGAGEMENT-PATTERN] as the intersection of structure/opening choices and tone/themes: structurally interesting or a specific opening pattern (without a cliffhanger), combined with either the right style tone or a thematic core that isn’t philosophical.

[AUDIENCE-READY]
A story is [AUDIENCE-READY] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [READABILITY-IMPACT]
  - The story is [STYLE-TONE]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
  - The story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST]

[AUDIENCE-READY] signals a story that’s suitable for audiences either because it pairs readability impact with the right tone or because it’s uniquely one of humorous or minimalist in style (but not both).

[OPTIMAL-ARC]
A story is [OPTIMAL-ARC] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [ENGAGEMENT-PATTERN]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [AUDIENCE-READY]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEMATIC-CORE]
    - The story is not [READABILITY-CLASS]

Finally, [OPTIMAL-ARC] is the sweet spot: the story shows an [ENGAGEMENT-PATTERN] and is either [AUDIENCE-READY] or carries a thematic core while lacking a fixed readability classification.

That’s it — same logic, same node IDs, laid out in a calmer, more conversational tone so you can read and apply it easily. If you’d like, I can also produce a compact checklist or a flowchart-style view that follows the exact same logic for quick annotation.
