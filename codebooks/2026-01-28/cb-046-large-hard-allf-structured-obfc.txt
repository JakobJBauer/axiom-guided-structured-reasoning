Codebook — Structured Edition

Overview
- This document lists all story annotation nodes and their exact logical definitions.
- Each node ID appears in [attr-3] form and is preserved exactly.
- Logical operations (Both / Either / Exactly one / Not) and their hierarchical relationships are retained verbatim, shown with clear indentation to guide annotation decisions.

2) Simple negation
- [attr-11]
  - A story is [attr-11] if the story is not [attr-16].

3) Exclusive / XOR relationship

      - The story is [attr-25]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-24]
      - The story is [attr-25]

- [attr-12]
  - A story is [attr-12] if both of the following are true:
    - [attr-28] is in the set of devices the story uses (it explicitly uses wh-questions)
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-27]
      - The story is [attr-14]

- [attr-4]
  - A story is [attr-4] if both of the following are true:
    - The set of themes in the story is equal to the set containing [attr-20] and [attr-19]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is [attr-22]
        - The story is [attr-5]
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is [attr-8]
        - The story is not [attr-13]

- [attr-1]
  - A story is [attr-1] if either of the following is true:
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-7]
      - The story is [attr-6]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-23]
      - The story is [attr-25]

- [attr-2]
  - A story is [attr-2] if either of the following is true:
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-1]
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is [attr-9]
        - Either of the following is true:
          - The story is [attr-20]
          - The story is [attr-21]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-4]
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is not [attr-11]
        - The story is [attr-12]

Notes for annotators (how to use this structure)
- Work top-down: identify atomic tags first (Section 1), then apply negation and exclusive rules (Sections 2–3), and finally evaluate compound nodes (Section 4).
- Follow the exact logical phrases:
  - "Both of the following are true" = logical AND (all listed conditions must hold).
  - "Either of the following is true" = logical OR (at least one must hold).
  - "Exactly one of the following is true" = XOR (precisely one holds).
  - "is not [attr-10]" = logical NOT (negation of that node).
- When a node refers to a "set of themes" or "set of devices," interpret that as the story's explicit, annotated themes/devices; matching must be exact for set equality conditions (as in [attr-4]).

End — All node IDs, logical relationships, and formula structures are retained unchanged for accurate annotation and reasoning.
