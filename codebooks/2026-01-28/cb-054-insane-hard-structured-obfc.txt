Notes for annotators (concise and practical)
- Atomic predicates are the building blocks; verify these first.
- Composite predicates must be evaluated by following their nested logical structure exactly (observe "Both of the following..." and "Either of the following..." patterns).
- The text preserves every node ID and logical connective as specified — do not alter them when applying labels.
- When a clause uses "exactly one," ensure only a single subcondition holds true.
- "The story is not [attr-51]" is a negation and must be treated strictly as exclusion.

This structured presentation keeps all node IDs, logical operators, and relationships unchanged while organizing the material for clear, step-by-step annotation.
