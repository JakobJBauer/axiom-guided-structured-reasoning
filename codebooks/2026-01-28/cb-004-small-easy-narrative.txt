Imagine a quiet archive where every tale is a little traveler arriving with a name-tag. The archivist, fond of clarity, writes a short key for each tag so future readers know exactly why a story earned it. Here are those keys — each one kept precise like an inscription on a wooden label, but told as if the archive itself were whispering the story of how we mark each tale.

[A small label is pinned to a story when it moves through this gate:]

[TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
A story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES] if the story is about seasonal changes.

The label for [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES] is for tales that follow the world as it turns — spring’s first green, summer’s heat, autumn’s falling leaves, winter’s hush.

[USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
A story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] if the story uses wh-questions.

This tag, [USES-WH-QUESTIONS], is for stories that ask — who, what, when, where, why, how — using those curious question-words to open doors and chase mysteries.

[STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
A story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] if the story starts with a noun.

Some stories announce themselves plainly. When the first word that greets the reader is a noun, the tale wears the [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] badge.

[TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
A story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] if the story is about cultural traditions.

Stories with the [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] tag carry the rituals and practices of communities — the songs, festivals, and handed-down ways that bind people to meaning.

[TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
A story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] if the story is about time travel.

When a tale folds time — sending characters backward or forward, or collapsing eras into one another — it earns the [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] mark.

[SEASONAL-QUESTION-STORY]
A story is [SEASONAL-QUESTION-STORY] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
- The story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]

There are moments when two traits meet: a story that follows the turning seasons and does so by asking wh-questions receives a double seal, [SEASONAL-QUESTION-STORY]. Picture a narrator asking “Why does autumn come?” as the leaves begin to fall — that precise conjunction is what this tag captures.

[TRADITION-OR-TIME-STORY]
A story is [TRADITION-OR-TIME-STORY] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
- The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]

Finally, some tales qualify if they hold either of two vivid possibilities: they are rooted in customs passed through generations, or they bend the river of time. If a story has either quality, it receives the [TRADITION-OR-TIME-STORY] label — a banner that tells the reader, “This tale walks in ritual or steps through eras.”

In this little archive, each tag is a careful decision — crisp, reliable, and written so that anyone who reads the labels will know exactly which gate the story walked through. The nodes and their links remain unchanged; the labels simply help us tell the stories in an orderly, human way.
