Overview
- Purpose: Define annotation labels (node IDs in brackets) and clear criteria for when a story should be assigned each label.
- Format: Each node is listed with a concise condition to guide annotators. Composite nodes explicitly state the logical relationship between component nodes.

Node definitions
- [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
  - Condition: Assign this label if the story is about cultural traditions.
  - Guidance: Use when traditions, rituals, customs, or culturally-specific practices are a primary topic or focus of the story.

- [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
  - Condition: Assign this label if the story contains a moral lesson.
  - Guidance: Use when the narrative communicates an explicit or implicit lesson about right/wrong, values, or expected behavior.

- [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
  - Condition: Assign this label if the story begins with an adverb (for example: "Suddenly," "Quickly," "Silently").
  - Guidance: Only consider the very first word/token of the story; if that first unit is an adverb, label accordingly.

- [THEME-MAGIC]
  - Condition: Assign this label if the story has the theme "Magic."
  - Guidance: Use when magical elements, supernatural abilities, spells, enchanted objects, or the concept of magic is a primary theme.

Composite node (logical rule)
- [TRADITIONAL-MAGIC-TEACHING]
  - Rule: This label applies only when all of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
    - The story is [THEME-MAGIC]
    - The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
  - Logical operation: AND (all listed component nodes must be present for [TRADITIONAL-MAGIC-TEACHING] to hold).

Quick annotation checklist
- To decide [TRADITIONAL-MAGIC-TEACHING], confirm:
  1. Is the story about cultural traditions? → [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
  2. Does the story center on magic as a theme? → [THEME-MAGIC]
  3. Does the story include a moral lesson? → [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
- If and only if all three answers are yes, assign [TRADITIONAL-MAGIC-TEACHING].

Notes for annotators
- Do not change node IDs; use the exact bracketed labels when tagging.
- Preserve the logical relationships: composite nodes require the specified component nodes exactly as listed.
- Apply each node independently unless a composite node explicitly combines them (as above).
