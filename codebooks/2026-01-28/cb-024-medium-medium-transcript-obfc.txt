Interviewer: Let's walk through this codebook together. I'll ask about each entry, and you answer with the exact condition it encodes. Ready?

Responder: Ready.

Interviewer: What does [attr-8] mean?

Responder: A story is [attr-8] if the story is playful.

Interviewer: And [attr-7]?

Responder: A story is [attr-7] if the story is minimalist.

Interviewer: How about [attr-3]?

Responder: A story is [attr-3] if the story has a moral lesson.

Interviewer: [attr-11]?

Responder: A story is [attr-11] if the story is about time travel.

Interviewer: What does [attr-6] indicate?

Responder: A story is [attr-6] if the story starts with a noun.

Interviewer: [attr-4] — what's the cutoff?

Responder: A story is [attr-4] if the story has more than 6 paragraphs.

Interviewer: And [attr-12]?

Responder: A story is [attr-12] if the story uses conditional mood.

Interviewer: What about [attr-9]?

Responder: A story is [attr-9] if the story has the theme Hardship.

Interviewer: Now for a composite: what defines [attr-2]?

Responder: A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-8]
- The story is [attr-7]

Interviewer: Clear. And [attr-1]?

Responder: A story is [attr-1] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-4]
- The story is [attr-12]
- The story is [attr-6]

Interviewer: How is [attr-10] defined?

Responder: A story is [attr-10] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-11]
- The story is [attr-3]

Interviewer: The last one looks nested. Explain [attr-5].

Responder: A story is [attr-5] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-1]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-2]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-8]
    - The story is not [attr-9]

Interviewer: Thanks — that preserves the logical structure clearly. Anything else you want to add for someone annotating with this codebook?

Responder: Just a quick note: treat each bracketed label as a strict tag. For composite nodes like [attr-2], [attr-1], [attr-10], and [attr-5], evaluate their listed conditions exactly as written — the logical connectors (both/and/all/either/not) determine whether the composite tag applies.
