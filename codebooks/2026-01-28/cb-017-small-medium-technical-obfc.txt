[attr-3]
Specification: A story is classified as [attr-3] if the story is humorous.

[attr-4]
Specification: A story is classified as [attr-4] if the story is lighthearted.

[attr-5]
Specification: A story is classified as [attr-5] if the story embodies the theme of kindness.

[attr-2]
Specification: A story is classified as [attr-2] if exactly one of the following conditions holds:
- The story is [attr-3]
- The story is [attr-4]

Notes: This node implements an exclusive-or constraint between [attr-3] and [attr-4]; membership in [attr-2] requires that precisely one of those style predicates evaluate to true.

[attr-1]
Specification: A story is classified as [attr-1] if both of the following conditions are satisfied:
- The story is [attr-5]
- Either of the following conditions hold:
  - The story is [attr-2]
  - Both of the following conditions hold:
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story is not [attr-3]

Notes: [attr-1] requires thematic alignment with [attr-5] and a style constraint that is either the exclusive style option ([attr-2]) or a conjunctive requirement of being lighthearted without being humorous.
