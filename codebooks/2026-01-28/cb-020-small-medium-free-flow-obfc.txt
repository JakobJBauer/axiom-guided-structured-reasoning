Think of these labels as a small set of clear, practical tags you can apply when reading or annotating a story. I’ll name each label by its ID and then say, in plain language, the exact condition under which that label applies — keeping every logical relationship and ID exactly as they appear.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if The story uses perfect aspect.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if The story is about cultural traditions.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if The story is about the arts.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if The story is lighthearted.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-6]
- The story is [attr-5]

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-1]
- The story is [attr-7]
- The story is not [attr-4]

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-1]
- The story is [attr-4]

That’s it — concise labels, each tied to precise conditions. Use them as a checklist when you annotate: check the simple tags first ([attr-7], [TOPIC-*], [STYLE-*]), then derive the composite tags ([attr-1], [attr-3], [attr-2]) by following the listed logical requirements.
