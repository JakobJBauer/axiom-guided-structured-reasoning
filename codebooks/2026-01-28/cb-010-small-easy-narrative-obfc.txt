Imagine a keeper of stories who sorts each tale into neat, glowing jars. Each jar has a name, a simple rule written on its lid, and the keeper speaks those rules like an incantation—clear, precise, and impossible to misread. Here are the lids and their whispered meanings.

[attr-4]
The keeper smiles and says: a story belongs in [attr-4] when it carries the theme of innovation—when invention, new ideas, or creative change are at its heart.

[attr-6]
Another lid reads [attr-6]. A tale is placed there when it dwells on cultural traditions—rituals, customs, and practices that communities pass down through generations.

[attr-5]
There is a jar labeled [attr-5]. Stories that live in that jar are those about bygone eras—narratives anchored in times long past, whose settings, sensibilities, or histories belong to earlier ages.

[attr-7]
The keeper taps a small chime for [attr-7]. A story is given this mark when it uses wh-questions—who, what, when, where, why, or how—to shape its curiosity or structure.

[attr-2]
A bright tag reads [attr-2]. The keeper slips it on any story that begins with a noun, the way a tale might open with “River,” “King,” or “Festival.”

[attr-3]
Another tag, [attr-3], goes on stories that begin with a preposition—those that start with “In,” “On,” “Under,” and the like.

Now comes a more intricate charm, a jar for stories that must satisfy several conditions at once.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-4]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-6]
  - The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-7]

In other words, the keeper explains, to earn the [attr-1] mark a tale must wear the innovation theme, must be about either cultural traditions or bygone eras, and must ask its questions with wh-words. It is a precise combination—three conditions bound together, one of them allowing two alternative paths—so the jar opens only for stories that meet every requirement exactly as described.

The jars stand in a row, each label a promise: the logic is strict, the rules unchanged, and the keeper’s storytelling registry remains both exact and delightfully human.
