Overview
- Purpose: This codebook defines annotation labels (nodes) for stories and the exact logical conditions that make each label true.
- Format: Each node is presented with:
  - Node ID (in brackets)
  - Plain-language definition
  - Precise logical criteria (kept identical in structure to the original)
- Note: All node IDs, logical operations, and relationships are preserved exactly as required.

Atomic (base) labels
- [attr-9]
  - Definition: The story uses conditional mood.
  - Criterion: A story is [attr-9] if the story uses conditional mood.

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: The story begins with an adverb.
  - Criterion: A story is [attr-6] if the story starts with a adverb.

- [attr-8]
  - Definition: The story contains the theme of Agency.
  - Criterion: A story is [attr-8] if the story has the theme Agency.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: The story is brief.
  - Criterion: A story is [attr-5] if the story has fewer than 160 words.

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: The story has a lighthearted tone.
  - Criterion: A story is [attr-7] if the story is lighthearted.

- [attr-10]
  - Definition: The story uses perfect aspect verbs (e.g., has/had done).
  - Criterion: A story is [attr-10] if the story uses perfect aspect.

Composite labels (built from atomic labels)
- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A conditional mood appears without perfect aspect.
  - Logical structure: Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-9]
    - The story is Not [attr-10]
  - Interpretation: [attr-3] = [attr-9] AND (Not [attr-10]).

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: The story is short and lighthearted.
  - Logical structure: Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is [attr-7]
  - Interpretation: [attr-4] = [attr-5] AND [attr-7].

- [attr-1]
  - Definition: The story expresses Agency and begins either with an adverb or is short — but not both.
  - Logical structure: Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-8]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-6]
      - The story is [attr-5]
  - Interpretation: [attr-1] = [attr-8] AND (exactly one of {[attr-6], [attr-5]}).

- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A short, lighthearted story that additionally meets either the mood/tense mix rule or the agency-start condition.
  - Logical structure: Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - Either of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-3]
      - The story is [attr-1]
  - Interpretation: [attr-2] = [attr-4] AND ([attr-3] OR [attr-1]).

Quick reference (logical formulas)
- [attr-3] = [attr-9] AND Not [attr-10]
- [attr-4] = [attr-5] AND [attr-7]
- [attr-1] = [attr-8] AND (Exactly one of {[attr-6], [attr-5]})
- [attr-2] = [attr-4] AND (Either {[attr-3], [attr-1]})

Annotator guidance (practical tips)
- Evaluate atomic labels first (e.g., does the story use conditional mood? Is it under 160 words?).
- Then apply composite rules exactly as written — pay special attention to:
  - Not: negation must be checked explicitly (e.g., Not [attr-10]).
  - Exactly one: treat this as exclusive OR — true only if one of the options is true and the other is false.
  - Either / And: preserve their intended logical meaning when combining conditions.
- Use the Quick reference formulas to speed up decisions once atomic labels are assigned.

End note
- All node IDs and logical relationships above are preserved from the original codebook. Follow this structured checklist when annotating to ensure consistent, reliable labeling.
