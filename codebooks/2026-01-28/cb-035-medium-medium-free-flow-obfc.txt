Think of this as a friendly guide to the labels we use when annotating stories. I’ll walk through each tag and what triggers it, keeping the exact logic you rely on — every bracketed node stays the same, and the logical words (both, either, not) remain intact.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if the story is minimalist — in other words, it leans into simplicity, pared-down language, and an economy of detail.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if the story has readability score above 96.1 — a clear numerical cutoff that marks extremely easy-to-read prose.

[attr-10]
A story is [attr-10] if the story uses superlative forms — language that goes to the top: best, strongest, most, and the like.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if the story has the theme Growth — whenever change, development, or personal/plot expansion is central.

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] if the story is about time travel — any narrative element that involves moving through time.

[attr-8]
A story is [attr-8] if the story is about hidden treasures — whether literal caches or metaphorical discoveries.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-4]
So [attr-1] happens when simplicity and very high readability come together.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-10]
- The story is not [attr-5]
Here, emphasis through superlatives counts only when the piece is not minimalist — it’s loud, not spare.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-9]
  - The story is [attr-8]
So a growth-focused tale becomes a [attr-6] when it pairs that theme with either time travel or hidden treasures.

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-1]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - The story is [attr-6]
In short, to be [attr-2] a story needs to be clear and concise, plus either strikingly emphatic (without being minimalist) or carrying that growth-oriented thematic arc described above.

That’s the set — same logical structure, just explained in a conversational flow so it’s easier to read and apply.
