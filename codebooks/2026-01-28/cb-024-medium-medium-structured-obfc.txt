Codebook — Structured version
Purpose
- Provide a clear, checklist-friendly reference for annotators.
- Preserve the exact logical relationships between labels while making the rules easier to follow.
- Keep all node IDs exactly as written (in [attr-1] form) and preserve all logical operators (Not, And, Or, etc.).

I. Atomic (single-condition) labels
- [attr-9]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-9] if the story is playful.
  - Quick check: Is the tone light, whimsical, or deliberately fun?

- [attr-8]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if the story is minimalist.
  - Quick check: Is the prose spare, focused, and economical?

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the story has a moral lesson.
  - Quick check: Does the narrative convey an explicit or implicit moral?

- [attr-12]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-12] if the story is about time travel.
  - Quick check: Are time travel elements central to the plot or setting?

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if the story starts with a noun.
  - Quick check: Does the very first token/word read as a noun?

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if the story has more than 6 paragraphs.
  - Quick check: Count paragraphs; more than six → label true.

- [attr-13]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-13] if the story uses conditional mood.
  - Quick check: Look for conditional constructions (would, could, might, if…).

- [attr-10]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-10] if the story has the theme Hardship.
  - Quick check: Does the story center on struggle, adversity, or hardship?

II. Composite labels — structure and checklist
- [attr-3]
  - Rule header: A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
  - Components:
    - The story is [attr-9]
    - The story is [attr-8]
  - Annotator checklist:
    1. Confirm [attr-9].
    2. Confirm [attr-8].
    3. If both confirmed → apply [attr-3].

- [attr-2]
  - Rule header: A story is [attr-2] if all of the following are true:
  - Components:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is [attr-13]
    - The story is [attr-7]
  - Annotator checklist:
    1. Verify >6 paragraphs → [attr-5].
    2. Verify presence of conditional mood → [attr-13].
    3. Verify first word is a noun → [attr-7].
    4. If all three hold → apply [attr-2].

- [attr-11]
  - Rule header: A story is [attr-11] if both of the following are true:
  - Components:
    - The story is [attr-12]
    - The story is [attr-4]
  - Annotator checklist:
    1. Confirm time-travel topic → [attr-12].
    2. Confirm a moral lesson → [attr-4].
    3. If both confirmed → apply [attr-11].

- [attr-6]
  - Rule header: A story is [attr-6] if both of the following are true:
  - Primary requirement:
    - The story is [attr-2]
  - Secondary (either/or) requirement:
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-3]
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is [attr-9]
        - The story is not [attr-10]
  - Annotator checklist (stepwise):
    1. Confirm [attr-2]. If not confirmed → do not apply [attr-6].
    2. If [attr-2] is true, evaluate the secondary condition:
       - Option A: Check [attr-3]. If true → apply [attr-6].
       - Option B: If [attr-3] is false, check both:
         a. [attr-9] is true, and
         b. [attr-10] is false (i.e., the story is not [attr-10]).
         - If both (a) and (b) hold → apply [attr-6].
    3. If none of the secondary options hold → do not apply [attr-6].

III. Practical annotation tips (keeps logic intact)
- Work top-down for composites:
  - First evaluate atomic labels.
  - Then evaluate composites by following their explicit logical connectors.
- For “not” conditions:
  - “The story is not [attr-10]” means absence of the hardship theme (do not invert other conditions).
- When in doubt:
  - Use the explicit checklist for each composite node; do not infer extra conditions beyond those listed.

IV. Summary reference (quick map)
- Atomic nodes: [attr-9], [attr-8], [attr-4], [attr-12], [attr-7], [attr-5], [attr-13], [attr-10]
- Composite nodes and their direct structures:
  - [attr-3] = both of: [attr-9] AND [attr-8]
  - [attr-2] = all of: [attr-5], [attr-13], [attr-7]
  - [attr-11] = both of: [attr-12] AND [attr-4]
  - [attr-6] = both of: [attr-2] AND (Either: [attr-3] OR (both: [attr-9] AND the story is not [attr-10]))

End — Follow these structured checks to apply labels consistently while preserving the exact logical relationships from the original codebook.
