Codebook — Structured version

Purpose
- Provide a clear, organized reference for annotators to decide which labels apply to a story.
- Maintain exact node IDs and logical relationships. Do not add, remove, or change any nodes or logical operators.

1) Atomic (single-condition) labels
- These labels are decided by a single observable property of the story.

  - [attr-6]
    - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if the story is minimalist.

  - [attr-4]
    - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the story has readability score above 96.1.

  - [attr-11]
    - Definition: A story is [attr-11] if the story uses superlative forms.

  - [attr-8]
    - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if the story has the theme Growth.

  - [attr-10]
    - Definition: A story is [attr-10] if the story is about time travel.

  - [attr-9]
    - Definition: A story is [attr-9] if the story is about hidden treasures.

2) Composite labels (logical combinations)
- These labels are defined by combining atomic labels with logical operators. Read each composite as: "A story is [attr-5] if ..." followed by the logical conditions.

  - [attr-1]
    - A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-6]
      - The story is [attr-4]

  - [attr-3]
    - A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-11]
      - The story is not [attr-6]

  - [attr-7]
    - A story is [attr-7] if both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-8]
      - Either of the following is true:
        - The story is [attr-10]
        - The story is [attr-9]

  - [attr-2]
    - A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-1]
      - Either of the following is true:
        - The story is [attr-3]
        - The story is [attr-7]

3) Quick annotation checklist (use this in order)
- Step 1 — Evaluate atomic properties:
  - Is the story minimalist? → mark [attr-6]
  - Is readability > 96.1? → mark [attr-4]
  - Does it use superlative forms? → mark [attr-11]
  - Is the theme Growth? → mark [attr-8]
  - Is it about time travel? → mark [attr-10]
  - Is it about hidden treasures? → mark [attr-9]

- Step 2 — Infer composite labels using the exact logical rules:
  - [attr-1]: apply when both constituent atomic labels are present.
  - [attr-3]: apply when [attr-11] is true and [attr-6] is false.
  - [attr-7]: apply when [attr-8] is true and at least one of the listed topics is true.
  - [attr-2]: apply when [attr-1] is true and at least one of ([attr-3], [attr-7]) is true.

4) Notes and tips for consistent decisions
- Preserve the logical operators exactly as stated:
  - "both of the following are true" = logical AND
  - "Either of the following is true" = logical OR
  - "is not" = logical NOT
- Do not infer a composite label unless all required logical conditions are satisfied.
- Evaluate atomic labels first; then apply the composite rules to avoid mistakes.
