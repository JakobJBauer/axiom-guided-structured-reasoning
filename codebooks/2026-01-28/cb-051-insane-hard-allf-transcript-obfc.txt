Interviewer: Let's go through this codebook together. I'll ask about each label, and you explain. Sound good?

Expert: Sounds great. Ask away.

Interviewer: What does [attr-27] mean?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-27] if The story has the theme Innovation"

In conversational terms: If a story’s central theme is Innovation, we tag it as [attr-27]. Think of inventions, creative breakthroughs, or an emphasis on new ideas.

Interviewer: And [attr-17]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-17] if The story is classic"

Plainly: Use [attr-17] when the story reads like a classic — traditional structure, timeless tone, familiar conventions.

Interviewer: [attr-31]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-31] if The story is about hidden treasures"

Simply: This tag is for stories centered on secret hoards, buried riches, or quests that uncover treasure.

Interviewer: [attr-13]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-13] if The story has fewer than 160 words"

Translation: If the whole piece is under 160 words, it qualifies as [attr-13].

Interviewer: [attr-14]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-14] if The story starts with a adjective"

Explanation: If the very first word of the story is an adjective, mark [attr-14]. (Yes, that includes words like "Quiet", "Ancient", "Brave".)

Interviewer: [attr-26]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-26] if The story has the theme Humor"

Plain: Tag stories whose theme centers on humor, comedy, or making the reader laugh.

Interviewer: [attr-9]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-9] if The story has readability score below 86.4"

Clarified: If the readability metric used falls below 86.4, assign [attr-9]. This is a numeric threshold.

Interviewer: [attr-19]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-19] if The story is modern"

Plain: Use [attr-19] when the story has a contemporary voice, references, or sensibilities.

Interviewer: [attr-34]?

Interviewer: [attr-23]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-23] if The story has the theme Growth"

Explanation: When growth (personal, emotional, skill-based) is the story’s theme, it’s [attr-23].

Interviewer: [attr-8]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-8] if The story has more than 375 words"

So: Anything exceeding 375 words is a [attr-8].

Interviewer: [attr-4]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-4] if The story has a moral lesson"

In plain terms: If the story explicitly or implicitly teaches a moral, tag it [attr-4].

Interviewer: [attr-6]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-6] if The story has circular narrative structure"

So: If the story is reflective, deals with big ideas, or has a philosophical bent, use this label.

Interviewer: Now for some of the composite labels. What is [attr-16]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-16] if the story's style is In the set { [attr-17], [attr-19], [attr-21], [attr-18], [attr-20] }"

Interpretation: [attr-16] holds when the story’s style matches any one of those five listed style nodes. It's a membership test — if the style is one of that set, [attr-16] is true.

Interviewer: Explain [attr-35].

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-35] if the story's topic is In the set { [attr-34], [attr-33], [attr-31], [attr-32], [attr-36] }"

Translation: This groups mystical or speculative topics. If the story’s topic is any of the listed ones, [attr-35] applies.

Interviewer: What about [attr-22]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-22] if either of the following are true (Or):
- The story is [attr-27]
- The story is [attr-23]
- The story is [attr-24]
- The story is [attr-25]
- The story is [attr-28]
- The story is [attr-29]
- The story is [attr-26]"

Explanation: [attr-22] is true if the story has any one of those themes. It’s inclusive — any match activates the cluster.

Interviewer: [attr-11]? That sounds specific.

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-11] if exactly one (Xor) of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-13]
- The story is [attr-8]"

Clarified: Use [attr-11] when the story is either short or long, but not both. It enforces exclusivity: precisely one of those length categories must hold.

Interviewer: [attr-12]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-12] if both of the following are true (And):
- The story is [attr-9]
- The story is [attr-14]"

Plain: This composite requires both conditions: low readability and that the story begins with an adjective.

Interviewer: [attr-15]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-15] if either of the following are true (Or):
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-6]
- The story is [attr-7]"

Explanation: If the story uses any of those structural devices (a nested story, circular structure, or juxtaposition), then [attr-15] applies.

Interviewer: [attr-10]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-10] if either of the following are true (Or):
- The story is [attr-4]
- The story is [attr-23]"

In everyday terms: This marker is true when the story has a moral lesson or centers on growth.

Interviewer: [attr-3] — what's that formal part mean?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-3] if Equal(the truth of [attr-23], the truth of [attr-24])"

Translation: This uses the Equal operator: [attr-3] is true when [attr-23] and [attr-24] are either both true or both false — i.e., they have equal truth values.

Interviewer: [attr-1]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true (And):
- The story is [attr-3]
- Either of the following are true (Or):
  - The story is [attr-28]
  - The story is [attr-25]"

Explanation: For [attr-1] you need equality between growth and hardship (per [attr-3]) and also at least one of kindness or helping-others themes.

Interviewer: [attr-30]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-30] if both of the following are true (And):
- The story is [attr-22]
- Either of the following are true (Or):
  - The story is [attr-1]
  - The story is [attr-27]"

Plain: [attr-30] requires the story to match the theme cluster (one of the listed themes) and also either be balanced between growth/hardship plus kindness/helping-others, or specifically have the innovation theme.

Interviewer: And finally, the big one: [attr-2]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [attr-2] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-30]
- The story is [attr-16]
- The story is [attr-35]
- The story is [attr-15]
- Not the story is [attr-17]
- The story is [attr-11]
- The story is [attr-12]
- The story is [attr-10]"

Translation and checklist: This label is strict — all those conditions must hold simultaneously.
- The story must satisfy [attr-30] (thematic requirements we discussed).
- Its style must be one of the styles in [attr-16].
- Its topic must be in [attr-35].
- It must use at least one structural device from [attr-15].
- It must NOT be [attr-17] (explicit negation).
- It must be either short or long, exclusively ([attr-11]).
- It must have low readability and start with an adjective ([attr-12]).
- And it must have a moral lesson or be about growth ([attr-10]).

Interviewer: That helps a lot. A couple quick clarifying questions: when you recite the formal lines you’re keeping the exact wording, right?

Expert: Yes. Each formal definition I quoted is verbatim from the codebook. Those lines are the authoritative logical formulas. My plain-language explanations are just to make them easier to apply, but they do not alter any of the logical structure or node IDs.

Interviewer: Great. Anything else the annotators should keep in mind?

Expert: Two practical tips:
1. Always check the atomic tags first (those single-condition nodes like [attr-29], [attr-13], etc.). They feed into composites.
2. When you evaluate composite nodes, match the logical operators exactly — Or means inclusive OR, And requires both, Xor requires exclusivity, Not negates, and Equal compares truth values. The composite definitions are deterministic if you compute them from the atomic truths.

Interviewer: Thanks — this transcript style makes the rules much more approachable while keeping the logic solid.

Expert: My pleasure. If you want, we can walk through an example story and apply the tags step by step.
