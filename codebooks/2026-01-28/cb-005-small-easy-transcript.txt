Interviewer: Let’s go through this codebook together. First question — what does [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] mean?

Expert: Straightforward. "A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if the story uses discourse markers."

Interviewer: And [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]?

Expert: "A story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] if the story has juxtaposition."

Interviewer: How about topics — what does [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES] denote?

Expert: "A story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES] if the story is about mystical creatures."

Interviewer: And similarly [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]?

Expert: "A story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES] if the story is about giant creatures."

Interviewer: There’s also [HAS-A-RED-HERRING]. What’s that?

Expert: "A story is [HAS-A-RED-HERRING] if the story has a Red Herring."

Interviewer: Now the compound labels — tell me about [FANTASTICAL-JUXTAPOSITION]. What conditions must hold?

Expert: "A story is [FANTASTICAL-JUXTAPOSITION] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
- The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]"

Interviewer: And the other compound one, [GIANT-MISDIRECTION]?

Expert: "A story is [GIANT-MISDIRECTION] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
- The story is [HAS-A-RED-HERRING]"

Interviewer: Just to be clear, you haven’t changed any of the IDs or the logical relationships here — they’re preserved exactly as in the original codebook?

Expert: Correct — all node IDs are intact in [BRACKET] format, every definition is preserved, and the compound nodes explicitly require both listed conditions (i.e., the logical AND). No nodes were added or removed.
