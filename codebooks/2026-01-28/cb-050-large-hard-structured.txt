Codebook — Structured Edition
Purpose: Present each label (node) clearly and hierarchically so annotators can reason about relationships and make consistent judgments. All node IDs, logical operators, and formula structures are preserved exactly as in the original. Read each label as: "A story is [NODE-ID] if ..." Follow the nested conditions literally when deciding whether a label applies.

3) How to use this structured codebook (annotator guidance)
- Read atomic labels first (Section 1) and decide whether each base condition holds for the story.
- Apply composite labels (Section 2) only after you have settled the relevant base labels that feed into them.
- When you see:
  - "Both of the following are true:" — treat this as logical AND: every listed subcondition must hold.
  - "Either of the following is true:" — treat this as logical OR: at least one listed subcondition must hold.
  - "Exactly one of ..." — treat this as exclusive OR: precisely one of the listed labels must be true, not both.
  - "The story is not ..." — treat this as logical NOT: the specified label must be false.
  - "All of the following are true:" — equivalent to multiple ANDs; every item listed must hold.
- Keep the original semantics: do not add or remove labels when determining whether a composite applies.

4) Quick check-list (practical shortcut)
- Verify paragraph count to determine [MANY-PARAGRAPHS].
- Scan for stylistic cues to set [STYLE-CLASSIC], [STYLE-MODERN], [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED].
- Identify explicit themes/topics: [THEME-INNOVATION], [THEME-GROWTH], [THEME-DECEPTION], [THEME-MAGIC], [TOPIC-THE-ARTS], [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS], [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS], [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS].
- Detect devices and forms: [HAS-A-RED-HERRING], [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN], [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT], [USES-WH-QUESTIONS], [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION], [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE].
- Combine these determinations to evaluate the composite labels exactly as specified.

End note: This structured layout preserves all original node IDs and logical relationships. Use it as a decision tree: confirm base labels first, then evaluate composites by following their precise logical structure.
