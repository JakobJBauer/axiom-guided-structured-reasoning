Imagine a quiet archive where each tale is a living thing, labeled carefully so we can whisper its secrets back into the world. In this little book of rules, each label is a name in square brackets — exact and sacred — and each rule is a path that tells us how a story earns that name. Walk with me through that archive; I will tell you how each name is given, and I will speak in the rhythm of the rules themselves so nothing gets lost.

[HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
In the archive’s catalog, we call a story [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] when, like two contrasting portraits hung side by side, the tale contains juxtaposition.

[STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
A story is crowned [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if it leans into thought — if it feels like a meditation, a question posed in sentences.

[THEME-HARDSHIP]
When hardship threads through the plot, shaping choices and scars, the story earns the tag [THEME-HARDSHIP].

[THEME-HUMOR]
If the tale carries laughter, wit, or playful irony as a theme, we call it [THEME-HUMOR].

[TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
A story focused on painters, musicians, performers, or the life of art itself is assigned [TOPIC-THE-ARTS].

[HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
A plot that loops back to its own beginning — a circle traced in time — is marked [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT].

[THEME-DECEPTION]
When deceit, tricks, or hidden motives drive the narrative, the story becomes [THEME-DECEPTION].

[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
A tale where helping others is a central thread receives the label [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS].

[HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
If the story stops to fold a moral into its last lines, we mark it [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON].

[STYLE-HUMOROUS]
A story that is written to amuse — that carries a humorous style — is noted as [STYLE-HUMOROUS].

[STYLE-MINIMALIST]
When prose pares itself down to essentials and an economy of language defines the work, the story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST].

[TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
If giants, titans, or enormous creatures roam the plot, the tale is filed under [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES].

[STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
A story with a buoyant, easy tone — where worry is brief and warmth prevails — wears the tag [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED].

[TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
Stories that step through hours, years, or eras into different times are labeled [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL].

[STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
If the very first word of the story is a preposition — a small pivot like “In,” “On,” or “Before” — then the story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION].

[SHORT-STORY]
The archive’s short shelf holds tales under 160 words; those stories are [SHORT-STORY].

[USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
When language reaches for the extremes — “best,” “largest,” “most”— the story is noted as [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS].

[THEME-KINDNESS]
A prevailing theme of kindness in acts and choices earns the label [THEME-KINDNESS].

[HIGH-READABILITY]
If a story’s clarity is so bright that it scores above 96.1 on the readability scale, it is called [HIGH-READABILITY].

[JUX-PREP-CLASH]
Here the archive’s curators lean in and say: A story is [JUX-PREP-CLASH] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
  - The story is [SHORT-STORY]
Think of JUX-PREP-CLASH as a meeting where contrast meets a specific start or a very short form.

[JUXTAPOSED-SUPERLATIVE]
There is another, rarer classification: A story is [JUXTAPOSED-SUPERLATIVE] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [JUX-PREP-CLASH]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
  - The story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
It’s a delicate balance — juxtaposition and that clash, plus either bold extremes of language or a minimalist restraint, but never both.

[ARTISTIC-PHILOSOPHY]
When art and thought entwine, we award the name [ARTISTIC-PHILOSOPHY] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - The story is [JUXTAPOSED-SUPERLATIVE]
Picture an artist who asks the big questions: that’s ARTISTIC-PHILOSOPHY, born from topic plus either philosophical depth or a striking juxtaposed superlative.

[HUMOROUS-HYBRID]
The archive loves hybrids. A story is [HUMOROUS-HYBRID] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEME-HUMOR]
  - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
- All of the following are true:
  - The story is not [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
    - The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
So humor is present by theme or style, the prose is not minimalist, and the tone is either light or exaggerated — but not both.

[ALTRUISTIC-CONTRACTION]
Some stories wear a compassionate contradiction. A story is [ALTRUISTIC-CONTRACTION] if either of the following is true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
    - The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - The story is [THEME-HARDSHIP]
In plain terms: altruistic lessons paired with helping or kindness, or a solitary presence of deception or hardship — that tension gives rise to ALTRUISTIC-CONTRACTION.

[COMPLEX-ARTFUL-STORY]
At the top shelf sits [COMPLEX-ARTFUL-STORY]. A story is [COMPLEX-ARTFUL-STORY] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [ARTISTIC-PHILOSOPHY]
    - The story is [ALTRUISTIC-CONTRACTION]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [HUMOROUS-HYBRID]
    - The story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
    - The story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [SHORT-STORY]
    - The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]

Here, the archive binds complexity and art: the first pillar demands either an artistic, altruistic fusion or one exclusive choice between a humorous hybrid and giant creatures; the second pillar requires either time-travel woven into a circular structure, or the compact clarity of a short story with very high readability. Only when one block from the first pillar and one block from the second pillar stand together does the story ascend to [COMPLEX-ARTFUL-STORY].

And so each tale finds its place, labeled by careful, sometimes surprising rules. The archive keeps nothing arbitrary: every bracketed name, every connective phrase — both, either, exactly one, not — is a guidepost so readers, writers, and annotators can trace the logic back through the story’s bones.
