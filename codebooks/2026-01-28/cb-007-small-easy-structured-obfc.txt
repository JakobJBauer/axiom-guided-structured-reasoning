Codebook — structured, clear, and ready for annotation

Overview
- Purpose: Provide concise, unambiguous definitions for each annotation node.
- Format: Each node is listed by its exact ID in [attr-1] format, followed by a short, natural-language definition and pragmatic annotation guidance.
- Logical combinations: Compound nodes preserve the original logical structure and operators (both/and/either/or). Do not change node IDs or their relationships.

Individual node definitions

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story qualifies as [attr-4] when its overall tone is lighthearted.
  - Annotation guidance: Mark this if the story’s voice and mood feel playful, breezy, or not serious.

- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story qualifies as [attr-3] when the very first word of the story is an adverb.
  - Annotation guidance: Check the opening token. If it is an adverb (e.g., “Quickly,” “Happily,” “Suddenly,” etc.), mark this node true.

- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A story qualifies as [attr-2] when it contains more than 375 words.
  - Annotation guidance: Count words; if count > 375, mark true.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story qualifies as [attr-5] when its primary theme is Humor.
  - Annotation guidance: Mark this if the central theme or intent of the piece is comedic or designed to make the reader laugh.

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story qualifies as [attr-6] when its subject matter concerns bygone eras (past historical periods).
  - Annotation guidance: Mark this if the story explicitly centers on, references, or is set in a past historical era.

Compound node: logical structure preserved

- [attr-7]
  - Natural-language summary: This node is true when a story is both lighthearted in style and comedic in theme, and additionally is either about bygone eras or begins with an adverb.
  - Formal logical structure (preserved exactly):
    - A story is WHIMSY-RETRO-COMEDY if both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-4]
      - The story is [attr-5] and either of the following is true:
        - The story is [attr-6]
        - The story is [attr-3]
  - Annotation checklist (step-by-step):
    1. Confirm [attr-4] is true.
    2. Confirm [attr-5] is true.
    3. Confirm at least one of the following:
       - [attr-6] is true, OR
       - [attr-3] is true.
    4. If steps 1–3 hold, mark [attr-7] true; otherwise mark false.
  - Tip: Treat the inner “and either” clause carefully — both the lighthearted style and the humor theme are required, and the topic/start condition is a necessary alternative paired with the humor theme.

Quick reference (compact)
- [attr-4]: Tone is lighthearted.
- [attr-3]: First word is an adverb.
- [attr-2]: > 375 words.
- [attr-5]: Theme = Humor.
- [attr-6]: Topic = bygone eras.
- [attr-7]: [attr-4] AND ([attr-5] AND ([attr-6] OR [attr-3]))

Notes for annotators
- Preserve the exact node IDs when tagging.
- Follow the logical flow for compound nodes; do not assume any implied shortcuts.
- Accuracy is critical: verify each atomic node before combining them into compound nodes.
