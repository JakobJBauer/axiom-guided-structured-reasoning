Interviewer: [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]?

Expert: A story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] if The story is about the arts.

Interviewer: Now the definitions get more complex. Explain [PLOT-STRUCTURE].

Expert: Sure. A story is [PLOT-STRUCTURE] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - either of the following is true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
    - The story is [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS]
  - either of the following is true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
    - The story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES] xor The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [HAS-A-RED-HERRING]
  - The story is [SHORT-STORY]

Interviewer: Let me check I understand. So one pathway to [PLOT-STRUCTURE] requires two grouped conditions: first, either hidden treasures or magical lands; second, either mystical creatures or an exclusive choice between giant creatures xor the arts. The alternative pathway is simply: it has a red herring and is a short story. Correct?

Expert: Correct. That restates the same logical structure.

Interviewer: Explain [TONE-AND-STYLE].

Expert: A story is [TONE-AND-STYLE] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS] xor The story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-CLASSIC]
  - not both of the following are true:
    - The story is [LOW-READABILITY]
    - The story starts with a preposition: The story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]

Interviewer: A quick clarification: "The story is in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-CLASSIC]"—that means the story must be both STYLE-MODERN and STYLE-CLASSIC, right?

Expert: Yes: the phrase "The story is in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-CLASSIC]" requires both listed styles to be true.

Interviewer: And "not both of the following are true" means at least one of those (LOW-READABILITY or STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION) must be false.

Expert: Exactly.

Interviewer: Moving to [THEMATIC-CORE]: how's that defined?

Expert: A story is [THEMATIC-CORE] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
  - either of the following is true:
    - The story is [THEME-INNOVATION]
    - The story is [THEME-MAGIC]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
  - The story is [THEME-HUMOR]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is in [THEME-MAGIC, THEME-INNOVATION, THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
  - The story is [THEME-KINDNESS] equals false

Interviewer: So there are three alternative ways to qualify for [THEMATIC-CORE]: (1) problem-solving plus either innovation or magic; (2) exactly one of kindness or humor; (3) the story must be in the set [THEME-MAGIC, THEME-INNOVATION, THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] (i.e., all three), and additionally THEME-KINDNESS must be false. Right?

Expert: That's an accurate interpretation of those clauses.

Interviewer: Next, [COMBINED-PLOT-TONE]?

Expert: A story is [COMBINED-PLOT-TONE] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [PLOT-STRUCTURE]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [TONE-AND-STYLE]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
    - The story is not [HAS-A-RED-HERRING]

Interviewer: So to meet [COMBINED-PLOT-TONE], you must satisfy [PLOT-STRUCTURE], and either satisfy [TONE-AND-STYLE] or have superlatives and no red herring.

Expert: Correct.

Interviewer: Finally, [COMPLEX-STORY-TYPE]?

Expert: A story is [COMPLEX-STORY-TYPE] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [THEMATIC-CORE]
  - exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [COMBINED-PLOT-TONE]
    - both of the following are true:
      - The story is [SHORT-STORY]
      - either of the following is true:
        - The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
        - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
- not both of the following are true:
  - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
  - The story is [THEME-HUMOR]

Interviewer: Let me paraphrase: One way into [COMPLEX-STORY-TYPE] is to be in the thematic core and, additionally, satisfy exactly one of these two options: either be [COMBINED-PLOT-TONE], or be a short story that is about the arts or hidden treasures. The other way in is simply that it's not the case that both STYLE-HUMOROUS and THEME-HUMOR are true simultaneously.

Expert: That's exactly what the definition states.

Interviewer: Great. Any final notes for annotators using this transcript-style codebook?

Expert: Two quick reminders:
- All node IDs like [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] must be used exactly as written when annotating.
- The logical operators—either, both, xor, exactly one, not both, equals false—are precise; preserve them when mapping story features to nodes.

Interviewer: Thanks — that keeps the logic intact and the structure clear.

Expert: Glad to help.
