Codebook — Structured View
Purpose: Present each node clearly and hierarchically so annotators can follow the logical requirements for labeling. All node IDs and logical relationships are preserved exactly as written.

1) Atomic (single-condition) nodes
- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if The story has a moral lesson.

- [attr-12]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-12] if The story uses perfect aspect.

- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-2] if The story has a cliffhanger.

- [attr-11]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-11] if The story has the theme Kindness.

- [attr-10]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-10] if The story is modern.

- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if The story has a flashback.

- [attr-8]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if The story is classic.

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if The story has more than 375 words.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if The story has juxtaposition.

- [attr-9]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-9] if The story is lighthearted.

2) Composite nodes (multiple logical conditions)
- [attr-7]
  - Summary: Use this label when all listed conditions below hold simultaneously.
  - Formal condition: A story is [attr-7] if all of the following are true:
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-2]
      - The story is [attr-3]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-5]
      - The story is [attr-12]
    - The story is not [attr-9]
    - At least one of the story's structural features is in the set { [attr-2], [attr-3], [attr-5] }

  - Notes for annotation:
    - “Either … is true” means at least one of the two listed structural features must be present.
    - “Exactly one … is true” requires an exclusive choice between the two listed features (one present, the other absent).
    - The final set membership requirement must hold even if it overlaps with earlier conditions.

- [attr-1]
  - Summary: This label requires that the story be both narratively rich and satisfy two style/theme relationships simultaneously.
  - Formal condition: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-7]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - Either of the following is true:
        - The story is [attr-11]
        - The story is [attr-4]
      - The presence of [attr-10] equals the presence of [attr-8]

  - Notes for annotation:
    - “Either … is true” in the nested condition: at least one of [attr-11] or [attr-4] must be present.
    - “The presence of [attr-10] equals the presence of [attr-8]” means these two style labels must match in presence — either both are present or both are absent.
    - All conditions above must be satisfied together for [attr-1] to apply.

3) Quick checklist (for annotators)
- To mark [attr-7], verify:
  - At least one of [attr-2] or [attr-3] is true.
  - Exactly one of [attr-5] or [attr-12] is true.
  - [attr-9] is false.
  - At least one of { [attr-2], [attr-3], [attr-5] } is true.

- To mark [attr-1], verify:
  - The story already meets all requirements for [attr-7].
  - At least one of [attr-11] or [attr-4] is true.
  - [attr-10] and [attr-8] either both appear or both do not appear.
