Interviewer: Let's go through this codebook line by line. First, what does [attr-6] mean?

Expert: A story is [attr-6] if the story uses conditional mood.

Interviewer: Simple enough. And [attr-7]?

Expert: A story is [attr-7] if the story uses perfect aspect.

Interviewer: What about themes—what does [attr-5] capture?

Expert: A story is [attr-5] if the story has the theme Deception.

Interviewer: And structural features—what is [attr-4]?

Expert: A story is [attr-4] if the story has a cliffhanger.

Interviewer: Now we’re getting to the composite nodes. Explain [attr-3].

Expert: Sure. A story is [attr-3] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is not [attr-4]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-6]
  - The story is [attr-7]

Interviewer: Let me double-check. So for [attr-3], the story must have the deception theme, must not have a cliffhanger, and must use at least one of conditional mood or perfect aspect. Is that correct?

Expert: Exactly. That restates the same logical structure.

Interviewer: Next: [attr-2]. How is that defined?

Expert: A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-6]
- The story is not both of the following:
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-6]

Interviewer: So [attr-2] means the story uses one of those two aspect/mood features, but not both at the same time. Correct?

Expert: Correct. The phrasing “Either of the following is true” plus “not both of the following” enforces that exactly one of [attr-7] or [attr-6] holds.

Interviewer: Finally, tell me about [attr-1].

Expert: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-3]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-2]
  - The story is not [attr-4]

Interviewer: To paraphrase: to qualify as [attr-1], a story must already meet the criteria for [attr-3], and additionally must either satisfy the exclusive-aspect condition ([attr-2]) or still be one that is not [attr-4]. Right?

Expert: Yes. That preserves the original logical relationships exactly: [attr-1] requires [attr-3], and then one of the two listed alternatives must hold.

Interviewer: Great. That preserves the structure while making the logic clearer in a conversational way.

Expert: Precisely—no node IDs, logical operators, or relationships were altered; we only explained them in an interview-style transcript for readability.
