Codebook — Structured Reference for Annotators

Purpose
- Provide a clear, actionable reference for labeling stories using the defined nodes.
- Keep logical relationships explicit and easy to follow when deciding which labels apply.
- Read each node carefully; use the checklists to make consistent, defensible annotations.

Notation and quick rules
- Node IDs appear exactly in brackets, e.g., [attr-4]. Do not change them.
- Follow the stated logical relationships exactly (e.g., “both of the following,” “exactly one,” “not,” “Either of the following”).
- Use the checklists below in order: determine simple properties first, then evaluate composite nodes that depend on them.

Nodes (in logical order)

1) [attr-4]
- Plain definition:
  - A story is [attr-4] if the story begins with an adjective.
- Decision checklist:
  - Look at the very first word of the story.
  - Is that first word an adjective (descriptive word like "Lonely", "Enormous", "Silent")?
    - Yes → mark [attr-4].
    - No → do not mark [attr-4].
- Annotation tip:
  - Ignore articles (a/an/the) or leading quotes; evaluate the first actual token/word that functions grammatically as the opening word.

2) [attr-5]
- Plain definition:
  - A story is [attr-5] if the story is about giant creatures.
- Decision checklist:
  - Does the core subject matter center on creatures of unusually large size (giants, colossal monsters, huge animals, etc.)?
    - Yes → mark [attr-5].
    - No → do not mark [attr-5].
- Annotation tip:
  - Focus on the main topic or recurring focus of the narrative, not a single passing metaphor or brief mention.

3) [attr-3]
- Logical definition (preserved exactly):
  - A story is GIANT-FOCUSED if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is not [attr-4]
- Plain explanation:
  - Mark [attr-3] only when the story is about giant creatures and its opening does not start with an adjective.
- Decision checklist:
  - Is the story about giant creatures? (Check [attr-5].)
  - Does the story NOT start with an adjective? (Check that [attr-4] is false.)
  - If both answers are true → mark [attr-3].
- Annotation tip:
  - This node combines topical focus and a property of the opening. Confirm both items independently before assigning.

4) [attr-1]
- Logical definition (preserved exactly):
  - A story is DYNAMIC-OPENING if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story is [attr-5]
- Plain explanation:
  - [attr-1] is an exclusive-or (XOR) relationship: mark it when either the story starts with an adjective or it is about giant creatures — but not both.
- Decision checklist:
  - Check [attr-4].
  - Check [attr-5].
  - Count how many of those are true:
    - If exactly one is true → mark [attr-1].
    - If zero or both are true → do not mark [attr-1].
- Annotation tip:
  - Use this node to flag openings that convey energy by either striking language at the start or an immediate giant-creature topic — choose only when the two do not coincide.

5) [attr-2]
- Logical definition (preserved exactly):
  - A story is ENGAGING-GIANT-STORY if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-3]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-1]
      - The story is not [attr-4]
- Plain explanation:
  - This label applies to stories that are focused on giant creatures and also meet an additional opening-related condition: either they have a dynamic opening (as defined above) or they simply do not start with an adjective.
- Decision checklist (stepwise):
  1. Confirm the story is [attr-3] (see node 3).
     - If NO → do not mark [attr-2].
     - If YES → continue.
  2. Evaluate the second clause:
     - Is the story [attr-1]? If yes → mark [attr-2].
     - If not, is the story not [attr-4]? If yes → mark [attr-2].
     - If neither subcondition holds → do not mark [attr-2].
- Annotation tip:
  - Because [attr-3] already includes “not [attr-4],” this node effectively requires a giant-focused story and then checks for either a dynamic opening or that same non-adjective start — follow the checklist literally to preserve correctness.

Quick decision workflow (recommended)
1. Determine atomic properties:
   - Decide [attr-4].
   - Decide [attr-5].
2. Compute composite nodes in this order:
   - [attr-3] (needs the two atomic decisions)
   - [attr-1] (depends on the two atomic decisions)
3. Finally decide:
   - [attr-2] (requires [attr-3] and one of the opening conditions)

Final annotation advice
- Work top-down for clarity: label the simple properties first, then the composite ones.
- When in doubt about grammatical categories (e.g., whether a word is an adjective) or topical focus, annotate conservatively and add a short note if allowed by your annotation interface.
- Preserve the logical definitions exactly as given when making decisions—these are the normative rules for assignment.
