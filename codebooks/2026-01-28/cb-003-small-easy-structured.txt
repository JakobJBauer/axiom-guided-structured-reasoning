Codebook — Structured Reference for Annotators

Purpose
- Provide a clear, step-by-step guide to the node definitions and their relationships.
- Help annotators think in a structured way while preserving all logical connections and node IDs.

Annotation workflow (recommended)
1. Identify atomic properties first (each single-node feature).
2. Record whether each atomic node applies.
3. Apply composite rules (if any) that require multiple atomic nodes to be true.

Atomic nodes (single-feature definitions)
- [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if the story starts with a preposition.
  - Annotator notes: Check the very first word or phrase of the story; label this node true when that initial token is a preposition (e.g., "In", "On", "Under", "With").

- [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
  - Definition: A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if the story uses discourse markers.
  - Annotator notes: Mark this true when connective or organizational words/phrases appear (e.g., "however", "then", "meanwhile", "on the other hand", "first", "finally").

- [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception.
  - Annotator notes: Label this true when deception (lying, trickery, fraud, misleading behavior) is a central theme or motif in the story.

- [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS] if the story is about magical lands.
  - Annotator notes: Apply this when the setting or primary focus is a land/realm characterized by magic or fantastical geography.

- [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] if the story is about cultural traditions.
  - Annotator notes: Use this when traditions, rituals, or practices of a culture are the story’s subject.

- [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] if the story is about the arts.
  - Annotator notes: Mark true when the story centers on artistic activity, artists, creative disciplines, or the world of the arts.

Composite nodes (logical combinations)
- [ARTFUL-DECEPTION-IN-FANTASY]
  - Definition: A story is [ARTFUL-DECEPTION-IN-FANTASY] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS]
    - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
    - The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
  - Logical interpretation: This node is true only when every listed atomic node is true (logical AND of the three components).
  - Annotator notes: First confirm each of the three component nodes separately; then set [ARTFUL-DECEPTION-IN-FANTASY] true only if all three component nodes are true.

Quick checklist (practical)
- Step 1: For each atomic node above, mark True/False based on the story text.
- Step 2: If [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS], [THEME-DECEPTION], and [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] are all True, then mark [ARTFUL-DECEPTION-IN-FANTASY] True; otherwise mark it False.
