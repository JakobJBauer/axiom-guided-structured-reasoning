Codebook — Structured format
Purpose: Provide clear, hierarchical definitions of annotation nodes and their logical relationships. Use this as a checklist when labeling stories.

1) Atomic attributes (basic, directly observable)
- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] when the story is playful.
  - Annotation cue: Mark this if the overall tone or approach of the story is playful.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] when the story is modern.
  - Annotation cue: Mark this if the story uses contemporary style, references, or sensibilities.

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] when the story starts with an adjective.
  - Annotation cue: Mark this when the very first word (or opening token) is an adjective.

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] when the story uses discourse markers.
  - Annotation cue: Mark this if the text contains discourse markers (e.g., however, therefore, meanwhile, etc.).

- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-2] when the story has Checkhov's gun.
  - Annotation cue: Mark this if an element introduced early is later used in the plot (Chekhov’s gun principle).

2) Composite attributes (logical combinations of atomic attributes)
- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is [attr-4]
  - Logical structure: AND([attr-5], [attr-4])

- [attr-1]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is either [attr-6] or [attr-7]
    - The story is [attr-2]
  - Logical structure: AND( OR([attr-6], [attr-7]) , [attr-2] )

3) Quick annotation workflow (practical steps)
- Step 1: Check atomic attributes first (STYLE-PLAYFUL, STYLE-MODERN, STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE, USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS, HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN).
- Step 2: Apply composite rules:
  - If both [attr-5] and [attr-4] are true, label [attr-3].
  - If [attr-2] is true and at least one of [attr-6] or [attr-7] is true, label [attr-1].
- Step 3: Double-check that each composite label reflects the exact logical combination defined above.

Notes and reminders
- Do not invent or delete nodes — use only the exact labels in brackets.
- Preserve the logical relationships when deciding composite labels.
- Treat the OR in [attr-1] as inclusive: either or both of the listed options may be present alongside [attr-2].
