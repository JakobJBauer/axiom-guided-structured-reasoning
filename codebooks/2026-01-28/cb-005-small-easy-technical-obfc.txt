Definition: A story satisfies [attr-6] when its subject matter concerns mystical creatures.
Specification: “Mystical creatures” refers to beings of supernatural, mythic, or magical provenance (e.g., dragons, fairies, spirits) that are central to the narrative’s topic or premise.
Annotation rule: Mark [attr-6] = true if mystical creatures are a primary topical focus.

[attr-3]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-3] when it contains a red herring.
Specification: A red herring is an intentional misleading cue or false lead introduced to divert attention from the actual explanation, outcome, or perpetrator.

[attr-1]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-1] when both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-6]
- The story is [attr-4]
Logical interpretation: [attr-1] = [attr-6] AND [attr-4]
Annotation rule: Mark [attr-1] = true only when the narrative simultaneously meets the criteria for mystical-creature topicality and for juxtaposition.

[attr-2]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-2] when both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-3]
Logical interpretation: [attr-2] = [attr-5] AND [attr-3]
Annotation rule: Mark [attr-2] = true only when the narrative simultaneously centers on giant creatures and employs a red herring as a misleading device.
