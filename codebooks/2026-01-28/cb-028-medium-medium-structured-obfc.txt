Codebook — structured reference

Purpose: Provide a clear, hierarchical description of each annotation node and the exact logical conditions that determine when a story satisfies that node. All node IDs, logical operators, and relationships are preserved exactly as in the original codebook.

1) Atomic (base) properties
- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-2] if the story has a moral lesson.
- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the story has more than 6 paragraphs.
- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if the story starts with a adverb.
- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if the story has circular narrative structure.
- [attr-9]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-9] if the story uses perfect aspect.
- [attr-10]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-10] if the story uses superlative forms.

2) Derived (composite) nodes — logical structure and conditions
- [attr-8]
  - Summary: Requires that the story starts with an adverb AND exactly one of two stylistic markers holds.
  - Formal conditions:
    - A story is [attr-8] if both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-7]
      - Exactly one of the following is true:
        - The story is [attr-9]
        - The story is [attr-10]

- [attr-6]
  - Summary: True when the story either has a circular narrative, or — if it does not have a circular structure — it has many paragraphs.
  - Formal conditions:
    - A story is [attr-6] if either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-3]
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is not [attr-3]
        - The story is [attr-4]

- [attr-5]
  - Summary: True when exactly one of the two length/moral properties holds: either a moral lesson or many paragraphs, but not both.
  - Formal conditions:
    - A story is [attr-5] if exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-2]
      - The story is [attr-4]

- [attr-1]
  - Summary: Indicates a high complexity story when it meets narrative-type requirements, and additionally either shows a specific stylistic choice or does not satisfy MORAL-OR-LONG.
  - Formal conditions:
    - A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
      - Either of the following is true:
        - The story is [attr-8]
        - The story is not [attr-5]
      - The story is [attr-6]

3) Quick logical maps (for reference)
- [attr-8] = [attr-7] AND exactly-one([attr-9], [attr-10])
- [attr-6] = [attr-3] OR (NOT [attr-3] AND [attr-4])
- [attr-5] = exactly-one([attr-2], [attr-4])
- [attr-1] = [attr-6] AND ( [attr-8] OR NOT [attr-5] )

Usage notes (annotator guidance)
- Evaluate atomic properties first (Section 1). These are the inputs used by the composite rules.
- Apply composite rules exactly as written—observe "both", "either", and "exactly one" carefully.
- The logical structure is intentional: do not simplify or alter the relationships when reasoning or implementing these conditions.
