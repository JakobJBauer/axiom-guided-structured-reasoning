Imagine a weathered map of storytelling—each symbol a rule, each rule a small village with its own law. Walk with me through that map. I will read each sign exactly as the codex requires, then whisper the tale that makes the rule breathe. The rules remain untouched; only the voice around them grows warm and human.

[attr-44]
A story is [attr-44] if The story is about magical lands

- When the narrative populates its world with titans and leviathans, this is the creature-passport it receives.
