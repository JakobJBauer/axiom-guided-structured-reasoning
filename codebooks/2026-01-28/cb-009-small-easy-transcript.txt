Interviewer: Good. Now, what does [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS] mean?

Interviewer: Got it. How about [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]?

Interviewer: Now for the composed nodes. Walk me through [EPICALLY-CONCISE-LOST].

Expert:
[EPICALLY-CONCISE-LOST]
A story is [EPICALLY-CONCISE-LOST] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]
- The story is [SHORT-STORY]

Interviewer: So to label something [EPICALLY-CONCISE-LOST], both conditions must hold at once. Understood. Lastly, explain [ORNATE-REFLECTIVE].

Expert:
[ORNATE-REFLECTIVE]
A story is [ORNATE-REFLECTIVE] if either of the following are true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
  - The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
  - The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]

Interviewer: So for [ORNATE-REFLECTIVE], we accept either of two conjunctions: (1) superlatives plus perfect aspect, or (2) perfect aspect plus juxtaposition.

Expert: Exactly. That keeps the logical structure intact: the node requires one of the listed options, and each option itself requires both of its subconditions.
