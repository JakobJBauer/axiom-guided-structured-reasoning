Imagine a small taxonomy of tales—an atlas of labels that whet the imagination and, at the same time, demand precision. Each label in this atlas is a lantern: it lights up only when a story walks into its circle of definition. Below, each lantern is introduced with a little flourish, then shown exactly how it decides whether a tale belongs under its glow.

[attr-6]
There is a quicksilver badge for openings that leap into motion: a single word that sets the scene by describing how something happens.  
A story is [attr-6] if The story starts with a adverb.

[attr-7]
Some tales wear the patina of tradition — rhythms, voice, and structure that feel timeless. That is the home of the classic.  
A story is [attr-7] if The story is classic.

[attr-4]
Other tales stretch wide across pages, building scenes and patience in equal measure. The guard here measures length.  
A story is [attr-4] if The story has more than 375 words.

[attr-9]
There is a label for stories whose horizons are populated by massive beings — the stomp and shadow of creatures that dwarf towns and tempers.  
A story is [attr-9] if The story is about giant creatures.

[attr-8]
Some narratives are woven around trickery, concealment, and misdirection; this theme marks that strand.  
A story is [attr-8] if The story has the theme Deception.

[attr-10]
There is also a compass for tales driven by buried maps, secret chests, and the hidden promise of riches.  
A story is [attr-10] if The story is about hidden treasures.

[attr-1]
Picture an epic that moves between domain and domain—long enough to be an odyssey, populated by towering beasts, and wearing a modern coat instead of a classical one. This badge lights up only when every part of that picture is true.  
A story is [attr-1] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-4]
- The story is [attr-9]
- The story is not [attr-7]

[attr-5]
Some quests promise treasure but hide their true aim behind guile. This label collects tales where deception and hidden spoils walk together — and either the opening leaps with an adverb or the tale refuses the classic mold.  
A story is [attr-5] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-8]
- The story is [attr-10]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-6]
  - The story is not [attr-7]

[attr-3]
Sometimes two distinct ideas cross paths, but the label calls for exclusivity: exactly one of the two flags must be raised. It celebrates the stories that are one kind of hybrid or the other — but not both.  
A story is [attr-3] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-1]
- The story is [attr-5]

[attr-2]
Finally, imagine a carefully engineered artifact of storytelling: it bears the mark of being a single-type hybrid, it must either have the timeless cadence of the classic or the breadth of a long story, and it refuses to begin with an adverb. Only when all these gates open together does this label apply.  
A story is [attr-2] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-3]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-4]
- The story is not [attr-6]

Read these lantern-labels as both map and rulebook: each bracketed name is exact, each logical gate is preserved, and the relationships between them form the pathways by which a tale earns its place.
