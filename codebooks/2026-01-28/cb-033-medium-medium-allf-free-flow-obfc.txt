I’ll smooth this codebook into a natural, free-flow voice while keeping every logical link exactly as it is and leaving all node IDs in their original [attr-1] form.

[attr-10]
We call a story [attr-10] if the story has the theme Humor.

A story is [attr-12] when it’s about lost civilizations.

  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is equal to [attr-10]
    - The story is not [attr-3]

That’s it — the same logical anatomy, simply spoken: each node remains intact, every logical operator and nesting preserved, and all IDs exactly as originally written.
