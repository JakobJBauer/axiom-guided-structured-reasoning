Purpose
- This codebook defines annotation labels (nodes) and the exact logical conditions that make a story qualify for each label.
- Node IDs are shown in [attr-1] format and must be used exactly as written.
- Logical relationships (And / Or / Both / Either) are preserved precisely as structured below.

Atomic (single-condition) nodes
- [attr-8]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if the story uses superlative forms.
  - Quick note: This label flags language that explicitly marks extremes (e.g., "the greatest," "the most ancient").

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if the story uses the perfect aspect.
  - Quick note: This label flags use of perfect tenses (e.g., "has seen," "had discovered").

- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if the story is about lost civilizations.
  - Quick note: This is a topical label (content-focused), not a stylistic one.

- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if the story has juxtaposition.
  - Quick note: Use this when contrasting images, ideas, or elements are placed side-by-side for effect.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if the story has fewer than 160 words.
  - Quick note: Word count is the only criterion for this node.

Compound (multi-condition) nodes
- [attr-2]
  - Condition: A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-6]
    - The story is [attr-5]
  - Interpretation: This label marks stories that are both about lost civilizations and extremely short (under 160 words).

- [attr-4]
  - Condition: A story is [attr-4] if either of the following are true:
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-8]
      - The story is [attr-7]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-7]
      - The story is [attr-3]
  - Interpretation: [attr-4] applies when the story combines perfect aspect with either superlatives or juxtaposition. In other words:
    - ( [attr-8] AND [attr-7] ) OR
    - ( [attr-7] AND [attr-3] )

Annotation guidance (practical reminders)
- Always refer to node IDs exactly as shown (e.g., [attr-6]).
- For compound nodes, verify each required sub-node independently before assigning the compound label.
- Preserve the logical structure: "both of the following are true" corresponds to logical AND; "either of the following are true" corresponds to logical OR.
- Do not introduce or remove nodes or alter relationships when annotating.
