[attr-2]
Definition: The predicate [attr-2] holds for a story if the story contains a flashback sequence.
Annotation criterion: Mark [attr-2] = true when at least one portion of the narrative explicitly represents past events relocated from the primary timeline (i.e., a flashback).

[attr-6]
Definition: The predicate [attr-6] holds for a story if the story employs one or more wh-questions in its text.
Annotation criterion: Mark [attr-6] = true when the narrative includes question forms beginning with wh-words (for example: who, what, when, where, why, how).

[attr-5]
Definition: The predicate [attr-5] holds for a story if the story makes use of discourse markers.
Annotation criterion: Mark [attr-5] = true when the text contains explicit discourse markers (connectives or pragmatic particles that structure discourse).

[attr-3]
Definition: The predicate [attr-3] holds for a story if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-6]
- The story is [attr-5]
Specification: This is an exclusive condition — [attr-3] is true when precisely one of the two predicates above holds; it is false if neither or both hold.

[attr-1]
Definition: The predicate [attr-1] holds for a story if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-2]
- The story is not [attr-3]
Specification: Both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously for [attr-1] to be true. Note that the second condition is the logical negation of [attr-3].

[attr-4]
Definition: The predicate [attr-4] holds for a story if either of the following is true:
- The story is in the set { [attr-3], [attr-1] }
- The story is equal to [attr-2]
Specification: [attr-4] is true when the story satisfies membership in the specified set or when it is exactly [attr-2]. This is a logical disjunction: if any listed condition holds, mark [attr-4] = true.
