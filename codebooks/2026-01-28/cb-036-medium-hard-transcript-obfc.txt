Interviewer: Let’s walk through this codebook together. I’ll ask about each node and you can read the rule. Ready?

Explainer: Ready.

Interviewer: What does [attr-2] mean?

Explainer: A story is [attr-2] if the story has readability score below 86.4

Interviewer: And [attr-11]?

Explainer: A story is [attr-11] if the story is about time travel

Interviewer: How about [attr-10]?

Explainer: A story is [attr-10] if the story is about seasonal changes

Interviewer: What does [attr-12] indicate?

Explainer: A story is [attr-12] if the story uses discourse markers

Interviewer: Explain [attr-4].

Explainer: A story is [attr-4] if the story starts with a adjective

Interviewer: And [attr-9]?

Explainer: A story is [attr-9] if the story is about hidden treasures

Interviewer: What about [attr-7]?

Explainer: A story is [attr-7] if the story has the theme Deception

Interviewer: [attr-8] — what’s that?

Explainer: A story is [attr-8] if the story has the theme Helping Others

Interviewer: [attr-6], please.

Explainer: A story is [attr-6] if the story starts with a preposition

Interviewer: And [attr-5]?

Explainer: A story is [attr-5] if the story starts with a adverb

Interviewer: Now the more complex ones. How is [attr-3] defined?

Explainer: A story is [attr-3] if either of the following is true:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is [attr-5]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-12]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-2]
    - The story is [attr-6]

Interviewer: Let me make sure I understand—so [attr-3] is true if either it starts with exactly one of adjective/adverb, or if it uses discourse markers and additionally is either low-readability or starts with a preposition. Correct?

Explainer: Correct. That restatement preserves the same logical structure.

Interviewer: Finally, the big one: [attr-1]. How is that specified?

Explainer: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-11]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-7]
      - The story is [attr-8]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-10]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-9]
      - The story is not [attr-11]
- The story is [attr-3]

Interviewer: So to confirm: [attr-1] requires two things at once — first, one of two complex topic-theme combinations (either time travel with exactly one of Deception/Helping Others, or seasonal changes combined with hidden treasures while explicitly not being time travel); and second, it must satisfy the [attr-3] condition. Right?

Explainer: Exactly. That explanation keeps the same logical relationships and operators.

Interviewer: That’s very clear. Is there anything else we should note about how to use these nodes?

Explainer: Just the practical reminders:
- Keep every node ID exactly as shown in brackets (for example, [attr-2]).
- Preserve the logical operators and the structure when annotating or reasoning (Not, And, Or, Exactly one, Either, Both).
- Do not add or remove nodes — use this set as-is for consistent annotation.

Interviewer: Great — thanks for the walkthrough. That transcript-style presentation keeps the original logic intact and makes it easier to follow.
