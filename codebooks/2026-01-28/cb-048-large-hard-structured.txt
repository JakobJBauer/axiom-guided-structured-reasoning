Codebook — Structured rewrite
Purpose: Present each node and its precise annotation logic in a clear, hierarchical format. All node IDs, logical operators, and relationships are preserved exactly as in the original. Use this as a checklist when labeling.

- [FANTASY-CORE]
  - A story is [FANTASY-CORE] if both of the following are true:
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS]
      - The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
      - The story is not [STYLE-MODERN]

- [COMPLEX-PATTERN]
  - A story is [COMPLEX-PATTERN] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [NARRATIVE-STRUCTURAL]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is [STYLE-AND-TONE]
        - The story is not [FANTASY-CORE]
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL-PROBLEM]
        - The story is [FANTASY-CORE]

- [SYNDIC-CONJUNCTION]
  - A story is [SYNDIC-CONJUNCTION] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [COMPLEX-PATTERN]
    - The story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL-PROBLEM] or the story is [FANTASY-CORE]
    - The story is [STYLE-AND-TONE] equals [STYLE-HUMOROUS]

III. Highest-level label (multi-branch logic)
- [STORY-ARCHETYPE]
  - A story is [STORY-ARCHETYPE] if either of the following is true:
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [SYNDIC-CONJUNCTION]
      - The story is [COMPLEX-PATTERN] in [COMPLEX-PATTERN, SYNDIC-CONJUNCTION, FANTASY-CORE]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [FANTASY-CORE] and the story is not [ARTS-TRADITIONAL-PROBLEM]
      - The story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL-PROBLEM] and exactly one of the following is true:
        - The story is [STYLE-AND-TONE]
        - The story is [NARRATIVE-STRUCTURAL]

IV. Quick annotation guidance (how to think structurally)
- Start from atomic labels (Section I). Determine truth for each simple property.
- Build composite labels (Section II) by following the exact logical constructions (both/either/all/exactly one/not).
- For [SYNDIC-CONJUNCTION] and [STORY-ARCHETYPE], evaluate all referenced composites; do not shortcut—verify each clause in order.
- Preserve the exact logical relations when deciding a label: do not alter any "not", "exactly one", "either", "both", or "all" conditions.
