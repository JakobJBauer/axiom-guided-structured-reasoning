Structured Codebook — concise, clear, and ready for annotation

Overview
- Purpose: Provide a clear, hierarchical reference for annotators. Each node is defined precisely. Logical relationships (And, Or, Exactly one, Both, equality, Not) are preserved exactly as in the original codebook.
- Usage: For each story, evaluate the atomic properties first, then evaluate composite nodes using the stated logical criteria.

Atomic (basic) labels
- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the story starts with an adjective.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if the story starts with a noun.

- [attr-8]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if the story is lighthearted.

- [attr-9]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-9] if the story is surreal.

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if the story is humorous.

- [attr-11]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-11] if the story has the theme Problem-Solving.

- [attr-10]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-10] if the story has the theme Deception.

Composite (derived) labels — logical constructions
- [attr-3]
  - Meaning: Exclusive start-type.
  - Rule: A story is [attr-3] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story is [attr-5]

- [attr-12]
  - Meaning: Playful tone (derived from style or combination of style + theme absence).
  - Rule: A story is [attr-12] if either of the following is true:
    - The story's style is in the set { [attr-8], [attr-7] }
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-9]
      - The story is not [attr-10]

- [attr-2]
  - Meaning: Presence of either deception or problem-solving theme.
  - Rule: A story is [attr-2] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-10]
    - The story is [attr-11]

- [attr-6]
  - Meaning: Style equality constraint.
  - Rule: A story is [attr-6] if the following equality holds:
    - [attr-8] = [attr-7]

- [attr-1]
  - Meaning: Complex story indicator combining start-type exclusivity with a single tonal/theme condition.
  - Rule: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-3]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-12]
      - The story is [attr-2]

Quick annotator checklist (practical ordering)
1. Determine atomic labels first:
   - Check start token: assign [attr-4] or [attr-5] as applicable.
   - Assign style labels: [attr-8], [attr-9], [attr-7] as appropriate.
   - Assign theme labels: [attr-11], [attr-10] if present.
2. Evaluate composite labels in the given sequence:
   - [attr-3] (check exclusive-start condition)
   - [attr-12] (use style set membership or the SURR real + not DECEPTION branch)
   - [attr-2] (either theme)
   - [attr-6] (verify equality)
   - [attr-1] (requires both [attr-3] and exactly-one of [attr-12] / [attr-2])

Notes and tips
- Preserve exact logical operators when reasoning: "exactly one" implies exclusivity; "either" allows one or the other (or both) only when explicitly used; "Both" requires both subconditions to be true.
- When a composite condition references an atomic node (e.g., [attr-9]), use your atomic annotations as the source of truth.
- Do not add or remove nodes; use these definitions strictly to maintain consistency across annotations.
