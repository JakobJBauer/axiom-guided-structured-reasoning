Notes on semantics:
- Each clause above defines a binary predicate on the space of candidate stories; a story satisfies a node when the node’s condition holds.
- Logical connectives and quantification are propositional and local to the definitions (e.g., “both of the following are true” denotes logical conjunction; “exactly one” denotes exclusive disjunction).
- The final conjunct in [COMPLEX-CRITERION] asserts equality of truth values between the proposition [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] and the negation of [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD].
