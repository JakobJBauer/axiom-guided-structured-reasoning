Interviewer: [attr-24]?

Expert: A story is [attr-24] if The story is about the arts.

Interviewer: Now the definitions get more complex. Explain [attr-5].

Expert: Sure. A story is [attr-5] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-21]
    - The story is [attr-22]
  - either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-23]
    - The story is [attr-20] xor The story is [attr-24]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - The story is [attr-6]

Interviewer: Let me check I understand. So one pathway to [attr-5] requires two grouped conditions: first, either hidden treasures or magical lands; second, either mystical creatures or an exclusive choice between giant creatures xor the arts. The alternative pathway is simply: it has a red herring and is a short story. Correct?

Expert: Correct. That restates the same logical structure.

Interviewer: Explain [attr-19].

Expert: A story is [attr-19] if both of the following are true:
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-11]
  - The story is [attr-10] xor The story is [attr-9]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-CLASSIC]
  - not both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story starts with a preposition: The story is [attr-8]

Interviewer: A quick clarification: "The story is in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-CLASSIC]"—that means the story must be both STYLE-MODERN and STYLE-CLASSIC, right?

Expert: Yes: the phrase "The story is in [STYLE-MODERN, STYLE-CLASSIC]" requires both listed styles to be true.

Interviewer: And "not both of the following are true" means at least one of those (LOW-READABILITY or STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION) must be false.

Expert: Exactly.

Interviewer: Moving to [attr-13]: how's that defined?

Expert: A story is [attr-13] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-18]
  - either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-15]
    - The story is [attr-17]
- exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-16]
  - The story is [attr-14]
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is in [THEME-MAGIC, THEME-INNOVATION, THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
  - The story is [attr-16] equals false

Interviewer: So there are three alternative ways to qualify for [attr-13]: (1) problem-solving plus either innovation or magic; (2) exactly one of kindness or humor; (3) the story must be in the set [THEME-MAGIC, THEME-INNOVATION, THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] (i.e., all three), and additionally THEME-KINDNESS must be false. Right?

Expert: That's an accurate interpretation of those clauses.

Interviewer: Next, [attr-1]?

Expert: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-19]
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-25]
    - The story is not [attr-3]

Interviewer: So to meet [attr-1], you must satisfy [attr-5], and either satisfy [attr-19] or have superlatives and no red herring.

Expert: Correct.

Interviewer: Finally, [attr-2]?

Expert: A story is [attr-2] if either of the following is true:
- both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-13]
  - exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-1]
    - both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-6]
      - either of the following is true:
        - The story is [attr-24]
        - The story is [attr-21]
- not both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-10]
  - The story is [attr-14]

Interviewer: Let me paraphrase: One way into [attr-2] is to be in the thematic core and, additionally, satisfy exactly one of these two options: either be [attr-1], or be a short story that is about the arts or hidden treasures. The other way in is simply that it's not the case that both STYLE-HUMOROUS and THEME-HUMOR are true simultaneously.

Expert: That's exactly what the definition states.

Interviewer: Great. Any final notes for annotators using this transcript-style codebook?

Expert: Two quick reminders:
- All node IDs like [attr-18] must be used exactly as written when annotating.
- The logical operators—either, both, xor, exactly one, not both, equals false—are precise; preserve them when mapping story features to nodes.

Interviewer: Thanks — that keeps the logic intact and the structure clear.

Expert: Glad to help.
