Codebook — Structured Version

Purpose
- Provide a clear, organized reference for annotators.
- Preserve all original node IDs, logical operators, and relationships exactly as given.
- Present each node and its conditions in a hierarchical, easy-to-scan layout.

Atomic (single-condition) labels
- A story is [attr-8] if:
  - The story has the theme Growth.

- A story is [attr-9] if:
  - The story has the theme Helping Others.

- A story is [attr-5] if:
  - The story starts with an adverb.

- A story is [attr-7] if:
  - The story is modern.

- A story is [attr-11] if:
  - The story is about seasonal changes.

- A story is [attr-12] if:
  - The story uses perfect aspect.

- A story is [attr-3] if:
  - The story has readability score below 86.4.

- A story is [attr-6] if:
  - The story is classic.

- A story is [attr-10] if:
  - The story is about mystical creatures.

- A story is [attr-2] if:
  - The story has readability score above 96.1.

Composite labels (logical combinations)
- A story is [attr-4] if all of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-11]
  - The story is [attr-8]
  - The story is not [attr-10]

- A story is [attr-1] if either of the following is true:
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story is [attr-9]
  - either of the following is true:
    - both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-7]
      - The story is not [attr-3]
    - both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-6]
      - both of the following are true:
        - The story is [attr-12]
        - The story is [attr-2]

Notes for annotators (kept concise)
- All node IDs must be used exactly as shown (including brackets).
- Logical words such as "all of the following", "both of the following", "either of the following", and "not" indicate precise boolean relationships — follow them literally.
- This structured layout mirrors the original logic while making it easier to check conditions step by step.
