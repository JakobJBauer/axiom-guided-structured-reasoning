[attr-9]  
In the old Scriptorium of Seven Lanterns, the librarians had a simple way to tell whether a tale had truly unfurled its full tapestry: a story is [attr-9] if the story has more than 6 paragraphs. When the parchment stretches beyond six distinct breaths of text, they mark it with this sign.

[attr-4]  
Among the mirror-halls of narration, some tales carry a smaller tale tucked inside them like a secret letter in a coat pocket. A story is [attr-4] if the story has a story within a story.

[attr-16]  
At the threshold of the first sentence, the gatekeeper of grammar listens for what steps forward first. A story is [attr-16] if the story starts with a noun—some person, place, thing, or named notion that leads the procession.

[attr-29]  
Certain storytellers cannot resist crowning their descriptions with laurels: the highest, the brightest, the most unforgettable. A story is [attr-29] if the story uses superlative forms.

[attr-5]  
In the theatre of inevitability, an object shown is an object destined. The archivists call it the vow of the first act. A story is [attr-5] if the story has Checkhov's gun.

[attr-21]  
When wonder hums beneath the lines—spells, enchantments, impossible transformations, or the shimmering logic of the uncanny—the theme has revealed itself. A story is [attr-21] if the story has the theme Magic.

[attr-28]  
Some narratives speak in lantern-lit “if” and “would,” in roads not taken and outcomes suspended like dew on a leaf. A story is [attr-28] if the story uses conditional mood.

[attr-30]  
There are tales that keep asking at the edges of the firelight—who, what, when, where, why, how—inviting the reader to lean closer. A story is [attr-30] if the story uses wh-questions.

[attr-22]  
Beneath floorboards, in sea-chests, under roots, behind false stones—some stories revolve around what is concealed and yearned for. A story is [attr-22] if the story is about hidden treasures.

[attr-20]  
Where cleverness reshapes the world—new devices, novel methods, bright leaps of invention—the scribes note a particular spark. A story is [attr-20] if the story has the theme Innovation.

[attr-24]  
If the narrative turns with the year’s great wheel—buds to blaze, blaze to fall, fall to hush, hush to thaw—its subject is clear. A story is [attr-24] if the story is about seasonal changes.

[attr-25]  
Some tales are steeped in creation: music, painting, dance, theatre, poetry—the arts as craft, calling, or crucible. A story is [attr-25] if the story is about the arts.

[attr-7]  
The Chronicle-keepers measure not only beauty but breadth: a story is [attr-7] if the story has more than 375 words. Beyond that count, the tale is deemed long enough to cast a longer shadow.

[attr-18]  
If a character stretches toward wisdom, if a heart learns to endure, if the self becomes more than it was—this is the garden of change. A story is [attr-18] if the story has the theme Growth.

[attr-23]  
Some narratives open onto realms that do not sit on ordinary maps—kingdoms of crystal weather, forests that whisper names, cities that float. A story is [attr-23] if the story is about magical lands.

[attr-26]  
When the plot folds time like paper—yesterday stepping into tomorrow, clocks made into doorways—the subject is unmistakable. A story is [attr-26] if the story is about time travel.

[attr-19]  
Where the pages carry hunger, loss, struggle, and the rough weather of life—where endurance is not decorative but necessary—the theme is heavy and true. A story is [attr-19] if the story has the theme Hardship.

[attr-14]  
Now and then, a tale begins not with a thing but with a manner—softly, suddenly, fiercely—like a gust announcing the scene. A story is [attr-14] if the story starts with a adverb.

[attr-3]  
In the Hall of Lessons, some stories leave behind a clear offering: a guiding principle, a caution, a distilled truth. A story is [attr-3] if the story has a moral lesson.

[attr-8]  
The scholars also consult their arcane meters of ease and effort. A story is [attr-8] if the story has readability score below 86.4—meaning the path through its sentences is comparatively thornier.

[attr-13]  
Occasionally, a story begins with pure description—golden, weary, silent—like a curtain rising on a single vivid quality. A story is [attr-13] if the story starts with a adjective.

[attr-15]  
The grammarians keep an opposing seal for beginnings that do *not* step forward as nouns. A story is [attr-15] if it is not [attr-16].

[attr-17]  
In the great ledger of forms, some works earn the title of grand architecture: a story is [attr-17] if both of the following are true:  
- The story is [attr-7]  
- The story is [attr-9]  
Length and layered paragraphing together raise the scaffolding of an epic frame.

[attr-2]  
There are voices that refuse the ordinary doorway into a tale, choosing instead a stranger threshold. A story is [attr-2] if either of the following is true:  
- Exactly one of the following is true: the story is [attr-14] or the story is [attr-13]  
- Both of the following are true:  
  - The story is [attr-15]  
  - The story is [attr-30]  
In other words, the opening is precisely one kind of unconventional flourish (adverb *or* adjective, but not both), **or** the tale begins with a non-noun and then proceeds to question the world with wh-questions.

[attr-11]  
In the guild of impossible designs—where enchantment shakes hands with invention—an ancient category is whispered. A story is [attr-11] if both of the following are true:  
- Either of the following is true:  
  - The story is [attr-21]  
  - The story is [attr-23]  
- Either of the following is true:  
  - The story is [attr-20]  
  - The story is [attr-26]  
Thus, it must bear **magic or magical lands**, and also bear **innovation or time travel**—a twin-signature of wonder and design.

[attr-6]  
Some stories live in the twilight of hypotheticals, asking questions while balancing on “if.” A story is [attr-6] if both of the following are true:  
- The story is [attr-28]  
- Either of the following is true:  
  - The story is [attr-30]  
  - The story is [attr-8]  
So the conditional mood must be present, and it must be accompanied by **wh-questions** or by **low readability**.

[attr-1]  
In the cabinet of nested tales, fate often hides in plain sight—either as a promised object or as language that proclaims supremacy while refusing the “if.” A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:  
- The story is [attr-4]  
- Either of the following is true:  
  - The story is [attr-5]  
  - Both of the following are true:  
    - The story is [attr-29]  
    - It is not [attr-28]  
So the tale must contain a tale within it, and then it must also contain **Checkhov’s gun**, **or** (superlatives **and** not conditional mood).

[attr-27]  
In the chronicles of buried gold and buried selves, the librarians name a particular arc: treasure braided with what the heart becomes. A story is [attr-27] if both of the following are true:  
- The story is [attr-22]  
- Either of the following is true:  
  - Both of the following are true:  
    - The story is [attr-18]  
    - The story is [attr-3]  
  - Both of the following are true:  
    - The story is [attr-19]  
    - It is not [attr-3]  
So it must be about hidden treasures, and then it must be either **growth with a moral lesson**, **or** **hardship without a moral lesson**.

[attr-12]  
When the year’s turning is the canvas, beauty may arrive through art—or through lofty superlatives paired with clarity. A story is [attr-12] if both of the following are true:  
- The story is [attr-24]  
- Either of the following is true:  
  - The story is [attr-25]  
  - Both of the following are true:  
    - The story is [attr-29]  
    - It is not [attr-8]  
Thus, seasonal changes must be the topic, and in addition the story must be **about the arts**, **or** must use superlatives while **not** being low-readability.

[attr-10]  
At the pinnacle of the Scriptorium’s secret curriculum sits a designation reserved for plots that feel both inevitable and artfully chosen, like a clockwork rose that blooms on cue. A story is [attr-10] if both of the following are true:  
- Either of the following is true:  
  - The story is [attr-1]  
  - Both of the following are true:  
    - The story is [attr-17]  
    - The story is [attr-6]  
- Exactly one of the following is true:  
  - The story is [attr-27]  
  - The story is [attr-12]  
So the story must have **embedded foreshadowing**, **or** it must be **both** a structural epic **and** interrogative conditionality; and, at the same time, it must be **exactly one** of treasured transformation or seasonal aesthetic—one jewel, not both, set into the crown.
