Think of this as a small, friendly map for tagging stories — each label is a node you can check off when a story matches the description. I’ll walk through each node plainly, keeping every logical link exactly as written so you can rely on this for annotation and reasoning.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if The story is about the arts

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if The story uses conditional mood

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if The story starts with a adjective

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if The story is philosophical

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- The story is not [attr-4]

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-6]
- The story is [attr-5]

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-3]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is in the set of topics that includes [attr-6]
  - The truth of [attr-5] is equal to the truth of not [attr-7]

That’s it — same nodes, same logic, just explained in a conversational way so the relationships are clear when you’re tagging or reasoning about stories.
