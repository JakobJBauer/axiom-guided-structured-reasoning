Interviewer: Let's go through this codebook together. First, what is [THEME-DECEPTION]?

Expert: A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if The story has the theme Deception.

Interviewer: Simple and clear. Next: [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]?

Expert: A story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY] if The story has a story within a story.

Interviewer: And [STYLE-SURREAL]?

Expert: A story is [STYLE-SURREAL] if The story is surreal.

Interviewer: How about [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]?

Expert: A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if The story has the theme Helping Others.

Interviewer: [STYLE-MINIMALIST]?

Expert: A story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST] if The story is minimalist.

Interviewer: [THEME-GROWTH]?

Expert: A story is [THEME-GROWTH] if The story has the theme Growth.

Interviewer: [STYLE-HUMOROUS]?

Expert: A story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS] if The story is humorous.

Interviewer: [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] — what does that label capture?

Expert: A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if The story uses discourse markers.

Interviewer: [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]?

Expert: A story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] if The story starts with a noun.

Interviewer: [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]?

Expert: A story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] if The story has circular narrative structure.

Interviewer: Now things get more logical. Explain [NARRATIVE-COMPLEXITY].

Expert: Sure — [NARRATIVE-COMPLEXITY] is defined with a clear logical condition. A story is [NARRATIVE-COMPLEXITY] if either of the following is true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
    - The story is [THEME-GROWTH]
- The story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] and the story is not [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]

Interviewer: Let me restate that to make sure I’ve got it. One way to meet [NARRATIVE-COMPLEXITY] is to have a story within a story, and alongside that, exactly one of the two themes — either [THEME-DECEPTION] or [THEME-GROWTH] — must hold. The other way is to have a circular narrative structure while not starting with a noun. Correct?

Expert: Exactly. That restates the two branches without changing the logical structure.

Interviewer: Great. Finally, what about [ENGAGING-STORY]?

Expert: [ENGAGING-STORY] ties together narrative complexity and some surface cues. A story is [ENGAGING-STORY] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [NARRATIVE-COMPLEXITY]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The truth of [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] equals the truth of [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] (both true or both false)
  - One of the following style nodes is in the story:
    - The story is [STYLE-SURREAL]
    - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
    - The story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST]

Interviewer: So to be an [ENGAGING-STORY], you must first satisfy [NARRATIVE-COMPLEXITY], and then either match the presence/absence of discourse markers with whether the story starts with a noun, or else be one of those three styles — surreal, humorous, or minimalist.

Expert: Yes — that captures the logic exactly: both the narrative condition and one of the two style/discourse conditions must hold.

Interviewer: Thanks — that was a clear walk-through. That preserves every node, every bracketed ID, and all the logical operators you specified.

Expert: You're welcome — the structure and logical relationships are unchanged; I only presented them as an interview for readability.
