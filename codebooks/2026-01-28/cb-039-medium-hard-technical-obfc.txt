Codebook — formal node definitions and logical specifications

Definitions below specify predicate conditions for story-level annotation. Each entry defines the predicate [attr-4] such that: a story satisfies [attr-4] if and only if the listed conditions hold. All node identifiers are preserved verbatim. Logical operators (Not, And, Or, xor, equals, and not) and the original compositional structure are retained.

[attr-11]
Definition: A story is [attr-11] if the story exhibits the theme “Deception.”

[attr-12]
Definition: A story is [attr-12] if the story exhibits the theme “Helping Others.”

[attr-9]
Definition: A story is [attr-9] if the story is philosophical in style.

[attr-2]
Definition: A story is [attr-2] if the story contains Checkhov's gun.

[attr-7]
Definition: A story is [attr-7] if the story’s opening token is a noun.

[attr-13]
Definition: A story is [attr-13] if the story’s subject matter concerns hidden treasures.

[attr-10]
Definition: A story is [attr-10] if the story exhibits the theme “Agency.”

[attr-6]
Definition: A story is [attr-6] if the story’s opening token is an adjective.

[attr-3]
Definition: A story is [attr-3] if the story employs juxtaposition.

[attr-5]
Definition: A story is [attr-5] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- The story is [attr-6] xor [attr-7]

[attr-8]
Definition: A story is [attr-8] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-11]
    - The story is [attr-13]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-2] xor [attr-10]
    - The story is [attr-11] and not [attr-10]

[attr-1]
Definition: A story is [attr-1] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-8]
- Not both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-12]
  - The story is [attr-9]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-7] equals true
    - The story is [attr-6] equals false

Notes for annotators and automated systems:
- Treat each line as a logical predicate: evaluate atomic predicates first (e.g., [attr-7], [attr-11]), then apply the specified boolean composition.
- The operator “xor” denotes exclusive-or (true when exactly one operand is true).
- The phrase “and not” denotes conjunction with logical negation of the second operand.
- The phrases “equals true” and “equals false” are explicit equality checks and must be evaluated as written.
- Maintain the nesting and ordering of conditions when implementing these predicates to preserve intended semantics.
