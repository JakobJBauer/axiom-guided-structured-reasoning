Overview
- Purpose: Provide a clear, structured reference for each annotation label (node).  
- Format: Each entry states the condition(s) under which a story is considered to have that label. Composite labels explicitly list the logical operations (And / Or / Not / Exactly one) that combine simpler labels.  
- Note: All node IDs are preserved exactly as written (in [attr-2] format). Logical relationships and formulas are unchanged.

Atomic labels (base conditions)
- [attr-10]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-10] if the story has the theme Agency.

- [attr-9]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-9] if the story starts with a noun.

- [attr-13]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-13] if the story is about giant creatures.

- [attr-11]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-11] if the story has the theme Kindness.

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the story has readability score above 96.1.

- [attr-14]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-14] if the story is about mystical creatures.

Composite labels (built from atomic labels)
- [attr-6]
  - Rule: A story is [attr-6] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-13]
    - The story is [attr-14]

- [attr-8]
  - Rule: A story is [attr-8] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-12]
    - The story is [attr-10]

- [attr-1]
  - Rule: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-11]
    - The story is [attr-8]

- [attr-7]
  - Rule: A story is [attr-7] if both of the following are true:
    - [attr-9] equals true
    - The story is not [attr-10]

Featured label (complex nested condition)
- [attr-3]
  - Rule: A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-6]
    - either of the following is true:
      - Branch A — both conditions must hold:
        - The story is [attr-1]
        - [attr-4] equals true
      - Branch B — both conditions must hold:
        - The story is [attr-7]
        - [attr-13] is in [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES, TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]

Usage guidance (how to read these rules)
- “Both of the following are true” indicates a logical AND: every listed sub-condition must hold.
- “Exactly one of the following is true” indicates exclusive OR: choose one and only one sub-condition must hold.
- “Either of the following is true” indicates logical OR: at least one of the branches must hold; each branch may itself require multiple conditions (AND).
- When a condition uses phrasing like “[attr-5] equals true” or “is not [attr-5],” apply the label’s truth as the boolean check.

End note
- This structured layout preserves the original logical relationships and node IDs. Use it as a checklist when annotating: evaluate atomic labels first, then apply composite rules in the order shown.
