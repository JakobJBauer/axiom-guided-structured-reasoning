Quick annotator checklist (practical steps)
- Step 1: Mark all simple labels that apply to the story from the Simple label definitions section.
- Step 2: For [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE], evaluate each nested clause in order. Treat “either”, “both”, and “exactly one” with their usual logical meanings. Pay special attention to the negations: phrases beginning with “It is not the case that” or “It is not both of the following are true” reverse the enclosed condition(s).
- Step 3: A story is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] only if the full top-level condition (the two main "both of the following are true" branches) is satisfied according to the nested structure shown above.

End notes
- This rewrite keeps every node ID and the full logical structure intact. Use the hierarchical layout to follow the logic stepwise when annotating.
