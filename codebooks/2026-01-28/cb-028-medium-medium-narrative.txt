Picture a quiet library at midnight, where each shelf holds a different way of recognizing what a story truly is. Each placard is stamped with a bracketed name — a little law that decides whether a tale belongs to a certain club. Below, I’ll walk you past those placards. I’ll keep every sign exactly as it hangs, including the bracketed names and the precise rules that govern them; I’ll only tell you the tale behind each rule so the logic reads like a story.

[HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
A story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON] if The story has a moral lesson.
Think of this as the sign by the hearth: any tale that hands you a clear lesson, a rule for life folded into its ending, earns this mark.

[MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
A story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS] if The story has more than 6 paragraphs.
This is the measure of length and breath — when a tale stretches past six paragraphs, it steps into the “many” territory and gets this label.

[STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] if The story starts with a adverb.
This badge is for openings that begin with the adverbial whisper — a “quickly,” “suddenly,” or “silently” that launches the narrative.

[HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
A story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] if The story has circular narrative structure.
Some stories orbit back to their beginning like a roundabout, and when they do, this is the structure they wear.

[USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
A story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] if The story uses perfect aspect.
When a tale makes use of the grammatical lens that looks back — the perfect aspect — it ticks this box.

[USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
A story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS] if The story uses superlative forms.
If a narrator calls something “the greatest,” “the smallest,” or otherwise crowns it with a superlative, the story carries this mark.

[STYLISTIC-CHOICE]
A story is [STYLISTIC-CHOICE] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
  - The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
This is a little salon for stylistic flair: a story must open with an adverb, and then choose exactly one kind of flourish — either the reflective perfect aspect or the boastful superlative — but not both. Think of it as an exclusive taste test where only one of the two accents pairs with the adverbial start.

[NARRATIVE-TYPE]
A story is [NARRATIVE-TYPE] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is not [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
  - The story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
This placard describes what makes something a narrative type: it’s either circular in structure, or, if it isn’t circular, it must be long enough — more than six paragraphs — to qualify. In other words, circular stories claim the label outright; non-circular ones must prove their length.

[MORAL-OR-LONG]
A story is [MORAL-OR-LONG] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
- The story is [MANY-PARAGRAPHS]
This is the exclusive fork: a tale is either moral or long, but it can’t be both. It must belong to exactly one of these camps.

[COMPLEXITY-HIGH]
A story is [COMPLEXITY-HIGH] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLISTIC-CHOICE]
  - The story is not [MORAL-OR-LONG]
- The story is [NARRATIVE-TYPE]
Here is the summit for complexity. To reach it, a story must first be a recognized narrative type (so it’s circular or sufficiently long). Then, on top of that, it must either bear the distinctive stylistic choice (that adverb-plus-exactly-one-flourish pattern) or deliberately not belong to the mutual-exclusion of moral or long (that is, it fails to be exactly one of moral or long). Only when both conditions are satisfied does the tale earn the [COMPLEXITY-HIGH] designation.

Walk away with this map in your head: each bracketed name is a gate; the bullets beneath are the locks. Read the locks exactly as they’re written, and you can sort any story into its rightful place on the shelves.
