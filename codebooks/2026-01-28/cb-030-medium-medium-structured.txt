Overview
- Purpose: This codebook defines annotation labels (nodes) for stories and the exact logical conditions that make each label true.
- Format: Each node is presented with:
  - Node ID (in brackets)
  - Plain-language definition
  - Precise logical criteria (kept identical in structure to the original)
- Note: All node IDs, logical operations, and relationships are preserved exactly as required.

Atomic (base) labels
- [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
  - Definition: The story uses conditional mood.
  - Criterion: A story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD] if the story uses conditional mood.

- [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
  - Definition: The story begins with an adverb.
  - Criterion: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] if the story starts with a adverb.

- [THEME-AGENCY]
  - Definition: The story contains the theme of Agency.
  - Criterion: A story is [THEME-AGENCY] if the story has the theme Agency.

- [SHORT-STORY]
  - Definition: The story is brief.
  - Criterion: A story is [SHORT-STORY] if the story has fewer than 160 words.

- [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - Definition: The story has a lighthearted tone.
  - Criterion: A story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] if the story is lighthearted.

- [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
  - Definition: The story uses perfect aspect verbs (e.g., has/had done).
  - Criterion: A story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] if the story uses perfect aspect.

Composite labels (built from atomic labels)
- [MOOD-MIX]
  - Definition: A conditional mood appears without perfect aspect.
  - Logical structure: Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
    - The story is Not [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
  - Interpretation: [MOOD-MIX] = [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD] AND (Not [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]).

- [PACING-AND-TONE]
  - Definition: The story is short and lighthearted.
  - Logical structure: Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [SHORT-STORY]
    - The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
  - Interpretation: [PACING-AND-TONE] = [SHORT-STORY] AND [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED].

- [AGENCY-START]
  - Definition: The story expresses Agency and begins either with an adverb or is short — but not both.
  - Logical structure: Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEME-AGENCY]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
      - The story is [SHORT-STORY]
  - Interpretation: [AGENCY-START] = [THEME-AGENCY] AND (exactly one of {[STARTS-WITH-ADVERB], [SHORT-STORY]}).

- [ELEGANT-STORY]
  - Definition: A short, lighthearted story that additionally meets either the mood/tense mix rule or the agency-start condition.
  - Logical structure: Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [PACING-AND-TONE]
    - Either of the following are true:
      - The story is [MOOD-MIX]
      - The story is [AGENCY-START]
  - Interpretation: [ELEGANT-STORY] = [PACING-AND-TONE] AND ([MOOD-MIX] OR [AGENCY-START]).

Quick reference (logical formulas)
- [MOOD-MIX] = [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD] AND Not [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
- [PACING-AND-TONE] = [SHORT-STORY] AND [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
- [AGENCY-START] = [THEME-AGENCY] AND (Exactly one of {[STARTS-WITH-ADVERB], [SHORT-STORY]})
- [ELEGANT-STORY] = [PACING-AND-TONE] AND (Either {[MOOD-MIX], [AGENCY-START]})

Annotator guidance (practical tips)
- Evaluate atomic labels first (e.g., does the story use conditional mood? Is it under 160 words?).
- Then apply composite rules exactly as written — pay special attention to:
  - Not: negation must be checked explicitly (e.g., Not [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]).
  - Exactly one: treat this as exclusive OR — true only if one of the options is true and the other is false.
  - Either / And: preserve their intended logical meaning when combining conditions.
- Use the Quick reference formulas to speed up decisions once atomic labels are assigned.

End note
- All node IDs and logical relationships above are preserved from the original codebook. Follow this structured checklist when annotating to ensure consistent, reliable labeling.
