Overview
- Purpose: Provide a compact, structured reference for annotators. Each entry below defines when a story should be labeled with a given node (the node ID is shown in brackets).
- Read this as: “A story is [attr-5] if <condition(s)>.”
- Logical constructs (And, Or, Not, Exactly one of, All of the following, Either of the following) are preserved exactly as written and indicate how conditions combine.

Node definitions (explicit, atomic)
- [attr-6]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-6] if The story is classic

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if The story is modern

- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if The story has a cliffhanger

- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if The story has more than 375 words

- [attr-8]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-8] if The story is about bygone eras

Composite nodes (rules combining atomic conditions)
- [attr-1]
  - Summary: Use this when a story is classic, long, and about bygone eras.
  - Rule form: A story is [attr-1] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-6]
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story is [attr-8]

- [attr-2]
  - Summary: This label applies when the story has a dynamic relationship between style and cliffhanger presence. The rule is satisfied if either of two alternative condition-sets holds.
  - Rule form: A story is [attr-2] if either of the following is true:
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-7]
      - The story is [attr-6]
    - All of the following are true:
      - The story is not [attr-6]
      - The story's style is equal to [attr-7]
      - The story is [attr-3]
      - The story's topic is in [attr-8]

Annotation guidance (how to apply these rules)
- Atomic nodes:
  - Evaluate each atomic condition directly from the story text or metadata (e.g., count words for [attr-4], identify explicit style or topic signals for style/topic nodes).
- Composite nodes:
  - For “all of the following are true”: require every listed bullet to hold before applying the composite label.
  - For “Exactly one of the following is true”: label the story only if precisely one of the listed conditions holds (i.e., XOR).
  - For “Either of the following is true”: apply the composite label if at least one of the two main branches is satisfied; each branch itself may contain its own logical structure (Exactly one, All of the following, Not, etc.).
- Notes:
  - Do not alter node IDs or the logical operators when performing annotation decisions.
  - When a branch contains “The story is not [attr-6]” plus “The story's style is equal to [attr-7],” both must be read together (they are part of an “All of the following are true” block).

Quick examples (illustrative)
- A long (400+ words) classic story about a historical period → satisfies:
  - [attr-6], [attr-4], [attr-8] → therefore [attr-1]
- A short modern story with a cliffhanger about bygone eras → satisfies:
  - For [attr-2], check first branch (Exactly one of [attr-7], [attr-6]): true if it’s modern and not classic → satisfies [attr-2]
  - Second branch also possible if all four conditions align (style modern, not classic, cliffhanger, topic bygone eras).

Keep this sheet handy while annotating: it preserves the exact logical relationships and node IDs you need to apply labels consistently and accurately.
