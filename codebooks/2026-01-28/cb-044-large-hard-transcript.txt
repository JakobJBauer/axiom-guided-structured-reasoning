Interviewer: Now let's move to compound definitions. Start with [JUX-PREP-CLASH]. How is that defined?

Expert: A story is [JUX-PREP-CLASH] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
  - The story is [SHORT-STORY]

Interviewer: So it needs juxtaposition plus either a preposition start or short length. Clear. What about [JUXTAPOSED-SUPERLATIVE]?

Expert: A story is [JUXTAPOSED-SUPERLATIVE] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [JUX-PREP-CLASH]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
  - The story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST]

Interviewer: That "exactly one" is important — it rules out both or neither. Next, [ARTISTIC-PHILOSOPHY]?

Expert: A story is [ARTISTIC-PHILOSOPHY] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - The story is [JUXTAPOSED-SUPERLATIVE]

Interviewer: So it's arts plus either philosophical style or that specific juxtapositional/superlative condition. Got it. Now [HUMOROUS-HYBRID] — this one looks more layered.

Expert: A story is [HUMOROUS-HYBRID] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEME-HUMOR]
  - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]

  - The story is not [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
    - The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]

Interviewer: To paraphrase: it must be humorous by theme or style, must not be minimalist, and must have exactly one of lighthearted style or superlatives. Correct. Let's continue: [ALTRUISTIC-CONTRACTION]?

Expert: A story is [ALTRUISTIC-CONTRACTION] if either of the following is true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
    - The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - The story is [THEME-HARDSHIP]

Interviewer: So it can be a moral lesson tied to helping or kindness, or exactly one of deception or hardship. The name hints at tension between altruism and contraction. Good. Finally, [COMPLEX-ARTFUL-STORY] — the big one.

Expert: A story is [COMPLEX-ARTFUL-STORY] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [ARTISTIC-PHILOSOPHY]

    - The story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [SHORT-STORY]
    - The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]

Interviewer: Let me restate that to ensure I have the logic right. For [COMPLEX-ARTFUL-STORY], you need one of two higher-level clusters on the first axis: either both [ARTISTIC-PHILOSOPHY] and [ALTRUISTIC-CONTRACTION], or exactly one of [HUMOROUS-HYBRID] or [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]. And on the second axis, you need either time-travel with circular narrative, or a short story with very high readability. Is that accurate?

Expert: Exactly. You captured the logical structure precisely.

Interviewer: Thanks — that walkthrough makes the codebook much easier to follow. Any final tips for annotators using these definitions?

Expert: Yes — always check each atomic node first (the simple labels like [THEME-HUMOR] or [SHORT-STORY]) and then apply the compound rules exactly as written: pay careful attention to "Either," "Both," "All," "Exactly one," and negations like "The story is not [STYLE-MINIMALIST]." Those words determine the logical flow and must be treated literally when annotating.
