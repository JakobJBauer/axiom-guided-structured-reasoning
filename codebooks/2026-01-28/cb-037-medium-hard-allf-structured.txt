Codebook — Structured Reference

Purpose: Provide clear, hierarchical definitions for each annotation node. Each entry states the exact logical condition(s) that make a story qualify for that node. All node IDs, logical operators, and relationships are preserved exactly as written.

Basic (atomic) nodes
- [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY] if the story has a story within a story.

- [THEME-MAGIC]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-MAGIC] if the story has the theme Magic.

- [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] if the story has a flashback.

- [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] if the story is about the arts.

- [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST] if the story is minimalist.

- [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] if the story has circular narrative structure.

Device / relation nodes (logical comparisons between devices)
- [DEVICE-XOR]
  - Definition: A story is [DEVICE-XOR] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
    - The story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
  - (Interpretation: exclusive OR — one and only one of those device nodes applies.)

- [DEVICE-EQUAL]
  - Definition: A story is [DEVICE-EQUAL] if the truth value of [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY] equals the truth value of [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT].
  - (Interpretation: both are true or both are false.)

Set-membership / theme combination
- [MAGIC-ART-MEMBER]
  - Definition: A story is [MAGIC-ART-MEMBER] if the story's primary theme or topic is in the set {[THEME-MAGIC], [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]}.
  - (Interpretation: primary theme/topic is either Magic or The Arts.)

Composite narrative nodes (combined logical requirements)
- [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE-CORE]
  - Definition: A story is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE-CORE] if both of the following are true:
    1. Either of the following are true:
       - The story is [DEVICE-XOR]
       - The story is [DEVICE-EQUAL]
    2. The story is not [STYLE-MINIMALIST] and (the story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] or the story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK])
  - (Interpretation: one of the device relations must hold, and the story must be non-minimalist while also having a circular structure or a flashback.)

- [ART-MAGIC-NARRATIVE]
  - Definition: A story is [ART-MAGIC-NARRATIVE] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [MAGIC-ART-MEMBER]
    2. Either of the following are true:
       - The story is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE-CORE]
       - The story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
  - (Interpretation: primary theme/topic is Magic or The Arts, and the story is either complex by the core definition or deliberately minimalist.)

Final composite node (exact exclusivity)
- [COMPLEX-ARTISTIC-NARRATIVE]
  - Definition: A story is [COMPLEX-ARTISTIC-NARRATIVE] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [ART-MAGIC-NARRATIVE]
    2. Exactly one of the following is true:
       - The story is [DEVICE-EQUAL]
       - The story is not [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
  - (Interpretation: must be an ART-MAGIC-NARRATIVE and satisfy an exclusive condition between [DEVICE-EQUAL] and the negation of [HAS-A-FLASHBACK].)

Notes for annotators (practical reminders)
- Preserve exact node semantics when deciding truth values. Do not conflate similar-sounding concepts.
- When a node requires compound conditions, ensure each sub-condition is evaluated individually and combined according to the specified logic (And / Or / Exactly one / Not / Equal).
- For set-membership [MAGIC-ART-MEMBER], treat the story’s primary theme or topic as the determining factor.
- For [DEVICE-EQUAL], check equality of truth values (both true or both false) — not structural similarity.
