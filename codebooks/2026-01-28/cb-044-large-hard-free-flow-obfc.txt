[attr-6]
Whenever a story places contrasting elements side by side — that feeling of two things rubbing up against each other to create meaning — we call it [attr-6]. In short: if the story has juxtaposition, tag it as [attr-6].

[attr-16]
If a story leans into big ideas, reflection, or philosophical inquiry, it falls under [attr-16]. When the tone or intent is contemplative, use this label.

[attr-18]
When struggle, suffering, or challenge is a core theme, the story is [attr-18]. If hardship drives the narrative or its message, mark it so.

[attr-20]
If humor is a defining theme — jokes, comedic situations, or an overall funny thrust — the story is [attr-20].

[attr-23]
Stories that are centered on the arts — painters, music, theater, craft, creative practice — are grouped under [attr-23].

[attr-5]
When the narrative loops back on itself or follows a circular arc, label it [attr-5]. If the structure returns to its starting point, that’s the cue.

[attr-17]
If deception — lying, trickery, or hidden motives — is a theme in the story, it should be marked [attr-17].

[attr-19]
When the story emphasizes helping others, acts of assistance, or altruistic deeds, it qualifies as [attr-19].

[attr-4]
If the story conveys a clear moral lesson — an explicit ethical takeaway — tag it as [attr-4].

[attr-13]
When the way a story is told is humorous — its style itself aims for laughs or wit — use [attr-13].

[attr-15]
A story that keeps things sparse, pared down, and economical in language is [attr-15]. If it’s stripped to essentials, that’s the sign.

[attr-22]
If giant creatures are central to the story — huge beasts or enormous entities — label it [attr-22].

[attr-14]
When a story carries a breezy, upbeat, or carefree tone, it fits [attr-14].

[attr-24]
Stories that involve moving through time or time-travel concepts should be marked [attr-24].

[attr-12]
If a story’s opening word is a preposition, tag it [attr-12].

[attr-11]
Use [attr-11] for pieces that are under 160 words — brief, compact stories.

[attr-25]
When a story uses superlatives (biggest, best, worst, most, etc.), mark it as [attr-25].

[attr-21]
If kindness — generosity, compassion, or benevolence — is a theme, label the story [attr-21].

[attr-7]
When a story scores above 96.1 on readability, it meets the threshold for [attr-7].

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] when two conditions hold together: first, it must be [attr-6]; and second, either it [attr-12] or it’s a [attr-11]. In other words, juxtaposition plus either a prepositional start or brevity makes a JUX-PREP-CLASH.

[attr-10]
We call a story [attr-10] when it meets these requirements: it is a [attr-9], and exactly one of the following is true — either it [attr-25] or it is [attr-15]. Precisely one, not both.

[attr-2]
A story becomes [attr-2] when it is rooted in [attr-23] and, in addition, it either embraces [attr-16] or qualifies as [attr-10]. So art + (philosophical style or that juxtaposed-superlative pattern) defines this node.

[attr-8]
Label a story [attr-8] when these two things are true at once. First, it must satisfy at least one of these: it has the theme [attr-20] or the style [attr-13]. Second, it must meet all of the following: it is not [attr-15], and exactly one of these holds — it is [attr-14] or it [attr-25]. Both conditions together create the humorous hybrid.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] in either of these ways. Option one: both of these are true — it [attr-4] and, additionally, it is either [attr-19] or [attr-21]. Option two: exactly one of these themes is present — either [attr-17] or [attr-18]. So it’s either moral plus altruistic theme, or a single presence of deception or hardship.

[attr-3]
Finally, [attr-3] requires two broad conditions to be met together. First, either:
- both [attr-2] and [attr-1] are true, or
- exactly one of these is true: [attr-8] or [attr-22].
And second, either:
- both [attr-24] and [attr-5] are true, or
- both [attr-11] and [attr-7] are true.

Put simply: a Complex Artful Story is a careful blend — an artistic or hybrid element together with either time-travel circularity or a short, highly readable form — arranged exactly as above.
