Interviewer: Let’s walk through this codebook together. I’ll ask what each node means and how it’s determined. Ready?

Expert: Ready. Ask away.

Interviewer: What does [attr-2] mean?

Expert: Simple: A story is [attr-2] if the story has a moral lesson.

Interviewer: And [attr-4]?

Expert: A story is [attr-4] if the story has more than 6 paragraphs.

Interviewer: How about [attr-7]?

Expert: A story is [attr-7] if the story starts with an adverb.

Interviewer: [attr-3]?

Expert: A story is [attr-3] if the story has circular narrative structure.

Interviewer: [attr-9]?

Expert: A story is [attr-9] if the story uses perfect aspect.

Interviewer: [attr-10]?

Expert: A story is [attr-10] if the story uses superlative forms.

Interviewer: Now it gets more interesting. Explain [attr-8].

Expert: Sure. A story is [attr-8] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-9]
  - The story is [attr-10]

Interviewer: So [attr-8] requires it start with an adverb and then exactly one of those two stylistic features. Clear.

Expert: Exactly—both conditions must hold: the adverb start plus exclusivity between perfect aspect and superlative forms.

Interviewer: Explain [attr-6].

Expert: A story is [attr-6] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-3]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is not [attr-3]
  - The story is [attr-4]

Interviewer: So [attr-6] is true if it’s circular, or if it’s not circular but has many paragraphs. That’s a neat way to capture two distinct narrative cases.

Expert: Yes—either explicit circular structure, or else long stories that aren’t circular.

Interviewer: What does [attr-5] capture?

Expert: A story is [attr-5] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-2]
- The story is [attr-4]

Interviewer: So [attr-5] is exclusive: it’s a moral story or a long story, but not both.

Expert: Correct—exactly one, never both.

Interviewer: Finally, [attr-1] — this looks layered. Break it down.

Expert: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-8]
  - The story is not [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-6]

Interviewer: So to be [attr-1], the story must be a [attr-6], and additionally it must either be a [attr-8] or fail to be [attr-5]. Right?

Expert: Exactly. Both top-level conditions must hold. First, it must satisfy the narrative-type condition. Second, within that, it must either meet the stylistic-choice rule, or it must not be (moral or long). Both lines of logic combine to label the story as high complexity.

Interviewer: That keeps the logical structure intact while making the conditions easier to ask about. Anything else to note?

Expert: Just this: every node here is a precise test. When annotating, check the atomic properties first—like [attr-7], [attr-9], [attr-2], and [attr-4]—then combine them according to the composite rules I described. That preserves all logical operations and relationships exactly as written.

Interviewer: Great—thanks for walking through the entire codebook in this Q&A format.
