Interviewer: Let’s go through this codebook together. First question — what does [attr-8] mean?

Expert: Straightforward. "A story is [attr-8] if the story uses discourse markers."

Interviewer: And [attr-5]?

Expert: "A story is [attr-5] if the story has juxtaposition."

Interviewer: How about topics — what does [attr-7] denote?

Expert: "A story is [attr-7] if the story is about mystical creatures."

Interviewer: And similarly [attr-6]?

Expert: "A story is [attr-6] if the story is about giant creatures."

Interviewer: There’s also [attr-4]. What’s that?

Expert: "A story is [attr-4] if the story has a Red Herring."

Interviewer: Now the compound labels — tell me about [attr-2]. What conditions must hold?

Expert: "A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- The story is [attr-5]"

Interviewer: And the other compound one, [attr-3]?

Expert: "A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-6]
- The story is [attr-4]"

Interviewer: Just to be clear, you haven’t changed any of the IDs or the logical relationships here — they’re preserved exactly as in the original codebook?

Expert: Correct — all node IDs are intact in [attr-1] format, every definition is preserved, and the compound nodes explicitly require both listed conditions (i.e., the logical AND). No nodes were added or removed.
