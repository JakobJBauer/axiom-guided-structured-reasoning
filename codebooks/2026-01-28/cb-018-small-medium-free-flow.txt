Think of this as a short, friendly guide to how we label stories — using the exact node names in brackets so nothing gets lost in translation.

[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
If a story’s central thread is about helping others, you’d tag it [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]. In plain terms: when the theme is Helping Others, that label applies.

[STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
When a story leans into ideas, reflection, or philosophical inquiry, mark it as [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]. If it’s philosophical, that’s the tag.

[STYLE-CLASSIC]
If a story feels classic in style — the traditional rhythms, structures, or sensibilities — it gets [STYLE-CLASSIC]. In short: classic stories = [STYLE-CLASSIC].

[HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
When a story sets contrasting elements side-by-side — striking contrasts or comparisons — label it [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]. If it has juxtaposition, that’s the identifier.

[MIXED-STYLE-JUXTAPOSE]
Use [MIXED-STYLE-JUXTAPOSE] when two conditions are both true:
- The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]
  - The story is [STYLE-MODERN]
So this tag is for stories that pair juxtaposition with either classic or modern style — but not both; exactly one of those styles must be present.

[STYLE-MODERN]
If the story reads with modern sensibilities — contemporary voice, techniques, or pacing — it’s [STYLE-MODERN]. In other words, modern stories = [STYLE-MODERN].

[PHILOSOPHICAL-HELPING-OTHERS-DRAMATIC]
This one is a little layered. A story is [PHILOSOPHICAL-HELPING-OTHERS-DRAMATIC] if either of the following is true:
- All of the following are true:
  - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - The story is not [MIXED-STYLE-JUXTAPOSE]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [MIXED-STYLE-JUXTAPOSE]
  - The story is not [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
So, to wear the [PHILOSOPHICAL-HELPING-OTHERS-DRAMATIC] label a story must either be philosophical and about helping others while not being a mixed-style juxtaposition, or it must be a mixed-style juxtaposition that is explicitly not about helping others.

That’s everything — same logic, same exact node names and relationships, just laid out in a smoother, conversational flow to make the rules easier to follow when you’re annotating.
