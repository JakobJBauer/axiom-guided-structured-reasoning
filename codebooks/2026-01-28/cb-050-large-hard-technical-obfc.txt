Notes on logical terminology used:
- AND indicates both subconditions must be true.
- OR indicates at least one subcondition must be true.
- XOR (described as “exactly one”) indicates exactly one of the listed subconditions must be true.
- NOT negates the truth of the referenced node.

All node identifiers and logical relationships are preserved exactly as specified above.
