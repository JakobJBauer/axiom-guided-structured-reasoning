Think of this as a friendly guide to the labels we use when annotating stories — each label is followed by the exact condition that makes it apply. I’ll keep things natural and easy to read, but the logical structure stays intact: the node IDs in [BRACKET] form, the connective words, and the formula shapes are unchanged.

[USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
A story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS] if The story uses superlative forms

[USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
A story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] if The story uses perfect aspect

[TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS]
A story is [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS] if The story is about lost civilizations

[HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
A story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] if The story has juxtaposition

[SHORT-STORY]
A story is [SHORT-STORY] if The story has fewer than 160 words

[EPICALLY-CONCISE-LOST]
A story is [EPICALLY-CONCISE-LOST] if both of the following are true:

That’s it — same nodes, same logic, just presented so it reads like a conversation rather than a dry checklist.
