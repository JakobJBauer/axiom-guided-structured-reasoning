Think of this as a gentle guide you can read like a conversation about how we tag stories. I’ll walk through each label, keeping every ID exactly as it appears and leaving all logical connections untouched — just making the wording smoother and easier to follow.

[attr-8]
If a story feels light, whimsical, and playful in tone, then it gets the [attr-8] label. In short: a story is [attr-8] if the story is playful.

[attr-7]
When a story strips away the excess and prefers spare language and simplicity, we call it [attr-7]. Concretely: a story is [attr-7] if the story is minimalist.

[attr-3]
If a story communicates a clear moral or lesson—something meant to teach or guide—mark it as [attr-3]. Formally: a story is [attr-3] if the story has a moral lesson.

[attr-11]
Stories that center on journeys through time, paradoxes, or time machines are labeled [attr-11]. Precisely: a story is [attr-11] if the story is about time travel.

[attr-6]
If the very first word of the story is a noun, then it qualifies as [attr-6]. In exact terms: a story is [attr-6] if the story starts with a noun.

[attr-4]
For stories that are broken into more than six paragraphs, use [attr-4]. To be exact: a story is [attr-4] if the story has more than 6 paragraphs.

[attr-12]
If a story regularly employs the conditional mood—phrases like “would,” “could,” or “if”—tag it [attr-12]. Formally: a story is [attr-12] if the story uses conditional mood.

[attr-9]
When hardship is a central theme—struggles, suffering, or hardship features heavily—label the story [attr-9]. Precisely: a story is [attr-9] if the story has the theme Hardship.

[attr-2]
This one is a simple conjunction: a story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-8]
- The story is [attr-7]

[attr-1]
Here we require a trio of traits together. A story is [attr-1] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-4]
- The story is [attr-12]
- The story is [attr-6]

[attr-10]
When time travel and a lesson come together, we use this label. A story is [attr-10] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-11]
- The story is [attr-3]

[attr-5]
This final label blends structural complexity with stylistic richness. A story is [attr-5] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-1]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-2]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-8]
    - The story is not [attr-9]

That’s everything. Each label above keeps its original ID and logical rules intact — just explained in a more natural, friendly way so you can apply them easily while annotating or reasoning.
