Think of this as a short, friendly guide to how we label stories — using the exact node names in brackets so nothing gets lost in translation.

[attr-7]
If a story’s central thread is about helping others, you’d tag it [attr-7]. In plain terms: when the theme is Helping Others, that label applies.

[attr-6]
When a story leans into ideas, reflection, or philosophical inquiry, mark it as [attr-6]. If it’s philosophical, that’s the tag.

[attr-4]
If a story feels classic in style — the traditional rhythms, structures, or sensibilities — it gets [attr-4]. In short: classic stories = [attr-4].

[attr-1]
When a story sets contrasting elements side-by-side — striking contrasts or comparisons — label it [attr-1]. If it has juxtaposition, that’s the identifier.

[attr-2]
Use [attr-2] when two conditions are both true:
- The story is [attr-1]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is [attr-5]
So this tag is for stories that pair juxtaposition with either classic or modern style — but not both; exactly one of those styles must be present.

[attr-5]
If the story reads with modern sensibilities — contemporary voice, techniques, or pacing — it’s [attr-5]. In other words, modern stories = [attr-5].

[attr-3]
This one is a little layered. A story is [attr-3] if either of the following is true:
- All of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-6]
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is not [attr-2]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-2]
  - The story is not [attr-7]
So, to wear the [attr-3] label a story must either be philosophical and about helping others while not being a mixed-style juxtaposition, or it must be a mixed-style juxtaposition that is explicitly not about helping others.

That’s everything — same logic, same exact node names and relationships, just laid out in a smoother, conversational flow to make the rules easier to follow when you’re annotating.
