Interviewer: Thanks — that preserves the logical structure clearly. Anything else you want to add for someone annotating with this codebook?

Responder: Just a quick note: treat each bracketed label as a strict tag. For composite nodes like [COMPOUND-STYLE], [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE], [TIME-MORAL], and [RICH-STYLE-NARRATIVE], evaluate their listed conditions exactly as written — the logical connectors (both/and/all/either/not) determine whether the composite tag applies.
