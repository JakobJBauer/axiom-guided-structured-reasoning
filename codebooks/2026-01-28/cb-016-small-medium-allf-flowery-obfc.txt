[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if
The story has the theme Helping Others.
- In the tapestry of narrative, this tag is applied when the overarching motif is one of compassion and assistance — when the story's heart beats for the well-being of others.

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if either of the following is true:
- The protagonist's central action is in the set {aid, rescue}
- The protagonist's central action is in the set {donate, teach}
- This label unfurls when the main deed performed by the protagonist centers on offering concrete help: whether through brave rescue or steady aid, or through generous donation or the patient imparting of knowledge.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if
- The protagonist's motive is equal to "personal gain"
- This marker is reserved for those tales where the inner engine of action is plainly self-regarding, where the aim behind deeds is the pursuit of one’s own advantage.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-2]
- The story is not [attr-3]
- Thus is declared an arc of selflessness: the protagonist performs helpful actions, and those actions are not driven by personal gain — a gentle moral geometry where benevolence stands unmarred by selfish intent.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-4]
- This final flourish captures exclusivity: the tale is marked for altruistic help when it either carries the broad theme of helping others or it specifically traces a selfless arc, but not both at once — a single, clear note in the symphony of kindness.
