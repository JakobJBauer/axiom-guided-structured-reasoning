Interviewer: Let's walk through this codebook like a conversation. I'll ask about each entry and you answer plainly. Ready?

Expert: Ready. Ask away.

Interviewer: What is [attr-8]?

Expert: A story is [attr-8] if The story has the theme Agency.

Interviewer: And [attr-7]?

Expert: A story is [attr-7] if The story starts with a noun.

Interviewer: How about [attr-11]?

Expert: A story is [attr-11] if The story is about giant creatures.

Interviewer: [attr-9] — what defines that?

Expert: A story is [attr-9] if The story has the theme Kindness.

Interviewer: [attr-3] — what's the threshold?

Expert: A story is [attr-3] if The story has readability score above 96.1.

Interviewer: And [attr-12]?

Expert: A story is [attr-12] if The story is about mystical creatures.

Interviewer: Now the first composite: How do we decide [attr-4]?

Expert: A story is [attr-4] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-11]
- The story is [attr-12]

Interviewer: What about [attr-6]? That sounds like a choice.

Expert: A story is [attr-6] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-10]
- The story is [attr-8]

Interviewer: So it's exclusive—one or the other, not both. Got it. Next: [attr-1]?

Expert: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-9]
- The story is [attr-6]

Interviewer: [attr-5] — what's required there?

Expert: A story is [attr-5] if both of the following are true:
- [attr-7] equals true
- The story is not [attr-8]

Interviewer: Finally, the big one: [attr-2]. How do we identify those?

Expert: A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-4]
- either of the following is true:
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-1]
    - [attr-3] equals true
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - [attr-11] is in [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES, TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]

Interviewer: To check I understand: a [attr-2] must first be a [attr-4]. Then it either (1) combines kindness-driven solver status with high readability, or (2) opens assertively and has [attr-11] listed among [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES, TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]. Is that right?

Expert: Exactly. You've restated the logical structure correctly.

Interviewer: Great — that covers every node. Anything else important to keep in mind while annotating with this codebook?

Expert: Two practical reminders:
- Keep the node IDs exactly as written (for example, [attr-8]) when you tag or refer to them.
- Preserve the logical operators and structure — "both," "either," "exactly one," "is not," "equals true," and "is in" are meaningful and determine how nodes combine.

Interviewer: Perfect. Thanks — that makes the codebook much easier to follow.
