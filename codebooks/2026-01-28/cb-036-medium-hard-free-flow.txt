Here’s a more natural, free-flow rendering of the same codebook — the ideas are the same, the logic is unchanged, and every node ID and logical connector is preserved exactly as before. I’ve smoothed the language so it reads like a conversation, but all relationships stay intact.

[LOW-READABILITY]
A story is [LOW-READABILITY] if the story has readability score below 86.4.

[TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
A story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] if the story is about time travel.

[TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
A story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES] if the story is about seasonal changes.

[USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if the story uses discourse markers.

[STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] if the story starts with a adjective.

[TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
A story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] if the story is about hidden treasures.

[THEME-DECEPTION]
A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception.

[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if the story has the theme Helping Others.

[STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
A story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if the story starts with a preposition.

[STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] if the story starts with a adverb.

[NARRATIVE-SURFACE]
Think of [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] as a label we give a story when one of two overall conditions is met. Either of the following is true:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [LOW-READABILITY]
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]

So in plain terms: a story qualifies for [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] if it begins distinctly with an adjective or an adverb (but not both), or if it uses discourse markers and is either hard to read (below that readability threshold) or begins with a preposition.

[INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE]
[INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE] is a bit more particular: it requires two main things to be true together. Both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
      - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
      - The story is not [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
- The story is [NARRATIVE-SURFACE]

To unpack that: a story becomes [INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE] when it meets [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] and, in addition, either (A) it’s about time travel and carries exactly one of two themes — Deception or Helping Others — or (B) it ties together seasonal changes and hidden treasures, but explicitly is not about time travel. The logic is strict: both the thematic/topic condition and the narrative-surface condition must hold at the same time.

That’s the whole codebook, translated into a more conversational flow while keeping every node, ID, and logical relationship intact.
