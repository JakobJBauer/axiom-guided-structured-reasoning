Structured codebook — clear, hierarchical definitions for annotators

Purpose
- Provide a compact, organized reference for annotating these story-level labels.
- Preserve exact node IDs and logical relationships; do not change any IDs, operations, or formulas.
- Use this as a decision checklist when assigning labels.

Core node definitions
- [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] if the story has a flashback.
  - Annotator note: Mark this whenever a portion of the narrative explicitly returns to an earlier time or event.

- [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
  - Definition: A story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] if the story uses wh-questions.
  - Annotator note: Look for questions beginning with who, what, when, where, why, how, etc.

- [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
  - Definition: A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if the story uses discourse markers.
  - Annotator note: Identify explicit connective/organizational words or phrases (e.g., however, then, meanwhile, on the other hand).

Compound and derived labels (logical rules)
- [INTERACTIVE]
  - Rule: A story is [INTERACTIVE] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
    - The story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
  - Interpretation: Apply [INTERACTIVE] only when one of those two source labels is present and the other is absent (this is an exclusive-or condition).

- [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]
  - Rule: A story is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
    - The story is not [INTERACTIVE]
  - Interpretation: Mark [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] when a flashback occurs and the story does not meet the exclusive-interactive condition above.

- [SPECIAL-CASE]
  - Rule: A story is [SPECIAL-CASE] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is in the set { [INTERACTIVE], [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] }
    - The story is equal to [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
  - Interpretation: [SPECIAL-CASE] applies when any of these hold:
    - The story is labeled [INTERACTIVE], or
    - The story is labeled [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE], or
    - The story is labeled [HAS-A-FLASHBACK].
  - Note: Because [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] alone implies [SPECIAL-CASE] (by the final disjunct), any flashback automatically meets [SPECIAL-CASE], and being [INTERACTIVE] or [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] also triggers it.

Quick decision checklist (step-by-step)
1. Does the story have a flashback?
   - If yes → assign [HAS-A-FLASHBACK].
2. Does the story use wh-questions?
   - If yes → assign [USES-WH-QUESTIONS].
3. Does the story use discourse markers?
   - If yes → assign [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS].
4. Determine [INTERACTIVE]:
   - Assign [INTERACTIVE] if exactly one of [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] or [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] is true.
5. Determine [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]:
   - Assign [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] if [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] is true AND [INTERACTIVE] is not true.
6. Determine [SPECIAL-CASE]:
   - Assign [SPECIAL-CASE] if any of: [INTERACTIVE], [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE], or [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] is true.

Final reminders for annotators
- Do not alter any node IDs or logical operators.
- Follow the exact logical rules above; the compound nodes depend on the primitive labels.
- Use the quick checklist to ensure consistent, reproducible labeling.
