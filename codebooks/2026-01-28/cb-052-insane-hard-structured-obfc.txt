Overview
- Purpose: This codebook defines annotation labels (nodes) for stories. Each node is written as [attr-19].
- How to read rules:
  - Simple definitions: “A story is [attr-18] if …” gives the direct criterion.
  - Composite rules use precise logical phrases:
    - “both of the following are true” = logical AND of all listed items.
    - “either of the following is true” = logical OR of listed items.
    - “all of the following are true” = logical AND across the group.
    - “exactly one of the following is true” = exclusive OR (XOR).
    - “not” = logical negation; written as “The story is not [attr-18]”.
- Node IDs are preserved exactly in [attr-1] form. Logical structure and relationships are unchanged.

Final notes for annotators
- Follow the exact logical phrasing provided when deciding whether a label applies.
- For composite nodes, evaluate the inner nodes first (atomic definitions and intermediate composites) and then apply the outer logical operator.
- Do not alter node IDs or logical operators; use them exactly as shown above.
