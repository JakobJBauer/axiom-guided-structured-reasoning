Codebook — Structured Reference for Annotators

Purpose
- Provide clear, action-oriented definitions for each node.
- Keep logical relationships explicit and easy to follow so annotators can reason consistently.

Nodes (each node ID must be kept exactly as shown)

1) [THEME-INNOVATION]
- Definition:
  - A story is [THEME-INNOVATION] if the story has the theme Innovation.
- Annotation cue:
  - Mark this when the central theme or focus of the story is innovation (new ideas, inventions, novel approaches).

2) [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
- Definition:
  - A story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] if the story is about cultural traditions.
- Annotation cue:
  - Mark this when the story discusses practices, rituals, customs, or cultural habits tied to a community or group.

3) [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
- Definition:
  - A story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS] if the story is about bygone eras.
- Annotation cue:
  - Mark this when the story centers on historical periods, past times, or things belonging to earlier eras.

4) [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
- Definition:
  - A story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS] if the story uses wh-questions.
- Annotation cue:
  - Mark this when the text contains wh-questions (who, what, where, when, why, how, etc.) used in the story.

Composite node — logical rule

5) [CULTURAL-INNOVATION-QUESTIONS]
- Definition (composite rule):
  - A story is [CULTURAL-INNOVATION-QUESTIONS] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEME-INNOVATION]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
      - The story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
    - The story is [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]
- Annotation checklist (apply all steps in order):
  1. Confirm the story meets [THEME-INNOVATION].
  2. Confirm that at least one of these topics applies:
     - [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS], OR
     - [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
  3. Confirm the story contains [USES-WH-QUESTIONS].
  4. If 1, 2, and 3 are all true, then mark [CULTURAL-INNOVATION-QUESTIONS].

Logical form (preserved for clarity)
- [CULTURAL-INNOVATION-QUESTIONS] = [THEME-INNOVATION] AND ([TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] OR [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]) AND [USES-WH-QUESTIONS]

Notes for annotators
- Preserve the exact node IDs when labeling.
- Apply the composite rule only when every required condition is met (the OR condition requires at least one of its options).
- Do not add or remove nodes; use the checklist to keep decisions consistent.
