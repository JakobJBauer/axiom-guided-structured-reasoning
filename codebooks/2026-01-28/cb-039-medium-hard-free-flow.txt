Think of this as a friendly guide to the tags and how they relate — written to flow like conversation, but keeping every rule and relationship exactly as written. I’ll introduce each label with a short, plain-English note and then show the precise logical definition that you’ll use for annotation or reasoning. All node IDs, logical operators, and formula structures are preserved exactly.

- [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - In plain terms: this label marks stories where deception is a central theme.
  - Formal definition: A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if The story has the theme Deception.

- [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - This one flags stories about helping others — where assistance or altruism is thematically important.
  - Formal definition: A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if The story has the theme Helping Others.

- [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - Use this when a story reads as philosophical, leaning into big ideas and reflection.
  - Formal definition: A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if The story is philosophical.

- [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]
  - A handy tag for the narrative device where a seemingly minor detail later matters — Chekhov’s gun.
  - Formal definition: A story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN] if The story has Checkhov's gun.

- [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
  - Simple and literal: the story’s very first word is a noun.
  - Formal definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] if The story starts with a noun.

- [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
  - This flags stories about hidden treasures — literal or figurative buried riches, secrets, and findable fortune.
  - Formal definition: A story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] if The story is about hidden treasures.

- [THEME-AGENCY]
  - For stories that emphasize agency — characters making choices and affecting their world.
  - Formal definition: A story is [THEME-AGENCY] if The story has the theme Agency.

- [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - Like [STARTS-WITH-NOUN], but for when the opening word is an adjective.
  - Formal definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] if The story starts with a adjective.

- [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
  - Use this for stories that place contrasting elements side-by-side to create meaning.
  - Formal definition: A story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] if The story has juxtaposition.

- [OPENING-PRIMACY]
  - This one captures a specific opening pattern. Think of it as saying: the opening matters if either the piece starts with a noun, or there’s an exclusive relationship between adjective and noun openings.
  - Formal definition: A story is [OPENING-PRIMACY] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] xor [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]

- [STRUCTURED-DECEPTION]
  - This label groups a few things that, together, indicate a tightly organized deceptive structure: an emphasis on the opening plus certain thematic or device-driven combinations. Read it as “opening primacy plus one of these deception-related conditions.”
  - Formal definition: A story is [STRUCTURED-DECEPTION] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [OPENING-PRIMACY]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
        - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
      - Either of the following is true:
        - The story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN] xor [THEME-AGENCY]
        - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION] and not [THEME-AGENCY]

- [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]
  - This final tag marks narratives that are built from the structured-deception pattern but avoid being simply altruistic or purely philosophical — and then add a specific surface or opening condition. In short: it requires [STRUCTURED-DECEPTION], forbids the simultaneous presence of helping-others and philosophical style, and then accepts either juxtaposition or a particular starts-with rule (explicitly expressed with equals true/false).
  - Formal definition: A story is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [STRUCTURED-DECEPTION]
    - Not both of the following are true:
      - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
      - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] equals true
        - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] equals false

That’s it — the same logic, the same nodes, and the exact operators, but written to feel more conversational and easy to follow while remaining precise for annotation and reasoning.
