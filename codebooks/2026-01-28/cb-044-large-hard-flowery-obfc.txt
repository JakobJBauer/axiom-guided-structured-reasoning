Prefatory flourish:
In a sunlit hall of manuscripts where ink sighs like petals and the rules of meaning wear garlands of metaphor, this codebook stands as a lovingly tended map. Each bracketed signpost is a lantern: they illumine qualities of tales and the subtle ways those qualities entwine. Below, the precise logical scaffolding remains unchanged — the architecture of truth is preserved like the bones of an ancient oak — while the language around each node unfurls in a more ornate, lyrical diction. Use these descriptions as you would a garden path: to guide, not to alter, the relationships already carved into the soil.
