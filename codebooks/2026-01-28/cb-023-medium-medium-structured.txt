Purpose
- This codebook defines labels (nodes) used to classify stories.
- Each label is given a clear condition. Composite labels combine simpler labels using logical operations (And, Or, Not).
- Keep this sheet nearby while annotating so you can apply labels consistently.

I. Atomic (single-condition) labels
- [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if the story is philosophical.

- [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] if the story is about the arts.

- [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK] if the story has a flashback.

- [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY] if the story has a story within a story.

- [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception.

- [HAS-A-RED-HERRING]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-RED-HERRING] if the story has a Red Herring.

- [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON] if the story has a moral lesson.

II. Composite (logical) labels — structure and conditions
- [REFLECTIVE-ARTS]
  - Logic: AND relationship
  - A story is [REFLECTIVE-ARTS] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
    - The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]

- [META-STRUCTURE]
  - Logic: OR relationship
  - A story is [META-STRUCTURE] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
    - The story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]

- [MISDIRECTION]
  - Logic: AND relationship
  - A story is [MISDIRECTION] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
    - The story is [HAS-A-RED-HERRING]

- [DIDACTIC-MISDIRECT]
  - Logic: AND with a NOT condition
  - A story is [DIDACTIC-MISDIRECT] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [MISDIRECTION]
    - The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
    - The story is not [REFLECTIVE-ARTS]

- [COMPLEX-PARABLE]
  - Logic: AND relationship between composite labels
  - A story is [COMPLEX-PARABLE] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [DIDACTIC-MISDIRECT]
    - The story is [META-STRUCTURE]

Quick annotation checklist (use with each story)
- Identify atomic properties first:
  - Is it philosophical? → [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - Is it about the arts? → [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
  - Any flashbacks? → [HAS-A-FLASHBACK]
  - Any story-within? → [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
  - Does deception drive the theme? → [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - Is there a red herring? → [HAS-A-RED-HERRING]
  - Is there an explicit moral lesson? → [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
- Then derive composite labels using the logical rules above:
  - Apply AND / OR / NOT exactly as specified for each composite node.

Notes on logical integrity
- Do not alter node IDs or the logical relationships shown.
- Composite labels depend strictly on the listed conditions (including negation for [DIDACTIC-MISDIRECT]).
- Use this structured view to reason step-by-step from atomic facts to higher-level labels.
