Think of this as a friendly guide to the tagging rules — written like a conversation, but precise enough for annotation and reasoning. I’ll keep every node ID exactly as it appears, and I won’t change any logical tests or relationships. Here’s the same codebook, made easier to read.

[attr-8]
We mark a story as [attr-8] when the story carries the theme Agency.

[attr-7]
We call a story [attr-7] when the story begins with a noun.

[attr-11]
A story is [attr-11] if the story is about giant creatures.

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] when it carries the theme Kindness.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if the story has a readability score above 96.1.

[attr-12]
A story is [attr-12] if the story is about mystical creatures.

[attr-10]
We tag a story as [attr-10] if the theme of the story is Problem-Solving.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-11]
- The story is [attr-12]

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-10]
- The story is [attr-8]

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-9]
- The story is [attr-6]

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if both of the following are true:
- [attr-7] equals true
- The story is not [attr-8]

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-4]
- either of the following is true:
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-1]
    - [attr-3] equals true
  - both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - [attr-11] is in [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES, TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]

That’s it — the same logic, just presented with a bit more conversational flow so it’s easier to read while you annotate.
