Imagine you are walking through an old library of stories — each spine labeled with a single, telling tag. These tags are the anchors of our codebook: short, precise identifiers in brackets that guide how we annotate and reason about a tale. Below, each tag is introduced as if discovered on a shelf, followed by the exact rule that explains when that tag applies. The logical bones remain untouched; the prose around them simply helps you see how the pieces fit together.

You pull out the first volume and find a quiet grammatical clue on its cover: the way the narrator frames time.
[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if The story uses perfect aspect

Nearby, a richly decorated folio captures customs, rituals and seasonal gatherings — the thread of heritage running through a plot.
[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if The story is about cultural traditions

Another spine glints with brushstrokes and stage lights — the domain of creativity and practice.
[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if The story is about the arts

Some stories have a spring in their step, the kind that leaves you smiling. This tag belongs to them.
[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if The story is lighthearted

As you arrange these books on the table, two particular labels combine into a recognizable collection: when a story is about both art and tradition, it becomes its own shelf.
[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-6]
- The story is [attr-5]

On the next shelf you find a volume that tugs gently at memory — it names works that honor old artistic practices and reflect on them with a retrospective voice. That tag is more selective: it requires the arts-and-traditions pairing, plus a particular tense, and it excludes breezy cheerfulness.
[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-1]
- The story is [attr-7]
- The story is not [attr-4]

Finally, tucked beside the nostalgic books, there’s a brighter subset: stories that celebrate traditional arts but do so with lightness and warmth.
[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-1]
- The story is [attr-4]

Read these tags as companions on your annotation journey: each bracketed name is exact, each logical connector remains the same, and together they form a small taxonomy — a shelf-by-shelf story of how topics, style, and grammar map onto one another.
