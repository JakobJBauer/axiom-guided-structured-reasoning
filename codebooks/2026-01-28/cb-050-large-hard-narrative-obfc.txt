Think of this codebook as a map of a storytelling kingdom. Each label is a signpost: sometimes a single clue, sometimes a crossroads of choices. I’ll walk you through these signposts like scenes in a tale—inviting, human, and clear—while leaving every rule, bracketed ID, and logical stitch exactly where it belongs.

Now the crossroads: when small signals combine, whole new labels are born. Imagine these as scenes where conditions must align.

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-5]
  - The story is [attr-6]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Exactly one of [attr-16] and [attr-25] is true
  - The story is [attr-8]

Think of [attr-9] as the sudden twist that arrives when a planted trick or a promised tool meets a particular pattern of questioning—or the patient breadth of many paragraphs.

[attr-10]
A story is [attr-10] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-8]
- The story is [attr-24]

[attr-10] feels like a long, reflective stretch — many paragraphs stitched with the perfect aspect that gives scenes a sense of having reached something.

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-13]
  - The story is [attr-15]
- The story is not [attr-14]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-12]
  - The story is [attr-11]

Picture [attr-2] as a duel of eras—one style winning out without the cushion of lightheartedness, and the opening words hinting at formality or description.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if either of the following is true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-21]
  - The story is [attr-20]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-22]
  - Exactly one of [attr-17] and [attr-16] is true

Here, [attr-3] is the echo of old rites or vanished empires—either a straightforward pairing of traditions with bygone eras, or the romance of lost civilizations tempered by an exclusive tilt toward growth or deception.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if either of the following is true:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-18]
  - The story is [attr-17]
- All of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-18]
  - The story is [attr-23]
  - The story is not [attr-17]

[attr-7] can be the exuberant bloom when invention partners with development, or a subtler pairing where innovation dances in the arts without explicit growth.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-23]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-3]

[attr-1] is the trunk of our artistic tree—stories about the arts that either wear the leaves of innovation-and-growth or the rings of cultural past.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-1]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-9]
    - The story is [attr-10]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-2]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-3]
    - The story is [attr-7]

Finally, imagine [attr-4] as a grand tapestry: it is woven when the arts-root stands tall, or when a surprising, richly long narrative comes together, and in its other dimension it requires a stylistic tension (classic vs. modern) or the fusion of cultural past with innovation and growth. It’s the label for stories that feel both vast and artful—mysterious by design and epic by breadth.

That’s the map: every node kept intact, every condition preserved. Read it as you would a rumoured legend—enjoy the language, trust the signs, and annotate with confidence.
