Codebook — Structured Edition

Overview
- This document lists all story annotation nodes and their exact logical definitions.
- Each node ID appears in [BRACKET] form and is preserved exactly.
- Logical operations (Both / Either / Exactly one / Not) and their hierarchical relationships are retained verbatim, shown with clear indentation to guide annotation decisions.

Notes for annotators (how to use this structure)
- Work top-down: identify atomic tags first (Section 1), then apply negation and exclusive rules (Sections 2–3), and finally evaluate compound nodes (Section 4).
- Follow the exact logical phrases:
  - "Both of the following are true" = logical AND (all listed conditions must hold).
  - "Either of the following is true" = logical OR (at least one must hold).
  - "Exactly one of the following is true" = XOR (precisely one holds).
  - "is not [NODE]" = logical NOT (negation of that node).
- When a node refers to a "set of themes" or "set of devices," interpret that as the story's explicit, annotated themes/devices; matching must be exact for set equality conditions (as in [EPIC-GROWTH-ARC]).

End — All node IDs, logical relationships, and formula structures are retained unchanged for accurate annotation and reasoning.
