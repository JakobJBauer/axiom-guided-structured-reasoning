Codebook — Structured Edition

Purpose
- Provide a clear, organized reference for annotators.
- Preserve all original nodes, IDs, and logical relationships exactly as given.
- Make it easy to decide when to apply each label.

I. Core (Atomic) Labels
- [attr-4]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-4] if the story is about seasonal changes.
  - Quick cue: Mentions of seasons, seasonal transitions, or effects tied to seasons.

- [attr-7]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-7] if the story uses wh-questions.
  - Quick cue: Presence of who/what/when/where/why/how questions in the text.

- [attr-2]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-2] if the story starts with a noun.
  - Quick cue: The very first word of the story is a noun (person, place, thing, concept).

- [attr-3]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-3] if the story is about cultural traditions.
  - Quick cue: References to rituals, customs, festivals, or culturally specific practices.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition: A story is [attr-5] if the story is about time travel.
  - Quick cue: Elements involving traveling to past or future times, time machines, temporal shifts.

II. Composite Labels (Logical Combinations)
- [attr-1]
  - Rule: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story is [attr-7]
  - Interpretation: Apply this label only when the story is about seasonal changes and it contains wh-questions.

- [attr-6]
  - Rule: A story is [attr-6] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-3]
    - The story is [attr-5]
  - Interpretation: Apply this label when the story is about cultural traditions, or about time travel, or about both.

III. Annotation Guidance (Practical, without changing rules)
- Decision flow (use this to think structurally):
  1. Check atomic labels first (Is it seasonal? Does it use wh-questions? Does it start with a noun? Is it about traditions or time travel?).
  2. Then assign composite labels by evaluating the listed conditions exactly:
     - For [attr-1], require both conditions to be true.
     - For [attr-6], require at least one condition to be true.
- Notes:
  - Do not invent intermediate nodes or alter any existing node IDs.
  - Preserve the logical operators: "both of the following are true" (AND), "either of the following is true" (OR).
  - Multiple labels may apply simultaneously if their conditions are met.

IV. Quick Examples (how to think about application)
- If a story discusses how leaves change color across seasons and asks "Why do leaves change?" → label both [attr-4] and [attr-7], therefore also [attr-1].
- If a story describes a harvest festival → label [attr-3] and therefore [attr-6].
- If a story involves traveling to the future but has no cultural tradition content → label [attr-5] and therefore [attr-6].

V. Final reminders
- All node IDs must remain exactly as shown (brackets and spelling).
- Logical relationships and formula structures must not be altered.
- Use the structured flow above for consistent, accurate annotation.
