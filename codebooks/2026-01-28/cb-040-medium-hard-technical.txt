Codebook — Technical specification

Atomic node definitions
- [THEME-AGENCY]
  - Classification rule: A story is assigned the label [THEME-AGENCY] if the narrative contains the thematic element "Agency".

- [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
  - Classification rule: A story is assigned the label [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] if the first lexical token of the story is a noun.

- [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
  - Classification rule: A story is assigned the label [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES] if its primary topic concerns giant creatures.

- [THEME-KINDNESS]
  - Classification rule: A story is assigned the label [THEME-KINDNESS] if it contains the theme "Kindness".

- [HIGH-READABILITY]
  - Classification rule: A story is assigned the label [HIGH-READABILITY] if its readability metric exceeds 96.1.

- [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
  - Classification rule: A story is assigned the label [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES] if its subject matter concerns mystical creatures.

- [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
  - Classification rule: A story is assigned the label [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] if it contains the theme "Problem-Solving".

Composite node definitions (logical specifications)
- [MYSTICAL-GIANTS]
  - Logical specification: A story is [MYSTICAL-GIANTS] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
    - The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]

- [SOLVER-OR-AGENCY]
  - Logical specification: A story is [SOLVER-OR-AGENCY] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
    - The story is [THEME-AGENCY]
  - Interpretation: This node encodes exclusive disjunction (XOR) between the two thematic labels.

- [ALTRUISM-SOLVER]
  - Logical specification: A story is [ALTRUISM-SOLVER] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
    - The story is [SOLVER-OR-AGENCY]

- [OPENING-ASSERTIVE]
  - Logical specification: A story is [OPENING-ASSERTIVE] if both of the following are true:
    - [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] equals true
    - The story is not [THEME-AGENCY]
  - Interpretation: This node identifies narratives that begin with a noun and explicitly do not carry the [THEME-AGENCY] label.

- [FEATURED-STORY]
  - Logical specification: A story is [FEATURED-STORY] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [MYSTICAL-GIANTS]
    - either of the following is true:
      - both of the following are true:
        - The story is [ALTRUISM-SOLVER]
        - [HIGH-READABILITY] equals true
      - both of the following are true:
        - The story is [OPENING-ASSERTIVE]
        - [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES] is in [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES, TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]
  - Interpretation: [FEATURED-STORY] requires the story to be both giant-related and mystical, and then to satisfy one of two alternative conjunctive branches: (1) it is an altruistic solver story with high readability, or (2) it is an assertive-opening giant story that meets the listed topic membership condition.

Notes on semantics and usage
- All definitions are binary: a label either applies or does not apply to a story.
- Composite nodes use standard logical connectives: conjunction (both of the following are true), disjunction (either of the following is true), negation (not), and exclusive disjunction (exactly one of the following is true).
- Node identifiers must remain exactly as specified (bracketed form) when referenced in annotations or automated rules.
