Notes for annotators and reasoners:
- Each node is a predicate evaluated on a story instance; composite nodes combine predicates using the explicit logical constructs shown above (Exactly one, Either, Both, All, Not, Or, And).
- Numeric thresholds (e.g., readability score 86.4) are concrete and must be applied as specified.
- Maintain these definitions as formal constraints when classifying or inferring node membership.
