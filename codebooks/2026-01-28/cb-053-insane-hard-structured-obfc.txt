Composite node: [attr-1]
- Purpose: Decide whether a story qualifies as [attr-1] by evaluating two main top-level conjunctions (both must be true). The exact nested logical structure is presented below; follow it step by step.

- [attr-1]
  - A story is [attr-1] if either of the following is true:
    - both of the following are true:
      - either of the following is true:
        - both of the following are true:
          - The story is in [attr-40], [attr-36], [attr-45]
          - The story is [attr-8]
        - either of the following is true:
          - The story is [attr-6]
          - both of the following are true:
            - The story is [attr-3]
            - It is not the case that both of the following are true:
              - The story is [attr-5]
              - The story is [attr-7]
      - both of the following are true:
        - exactly one of the following is true:
          - The story is [attr-19]
          - The story is [attr-23]
        - either of the following is true:
          - both of the following are true:
            - The story is [attr-34]
            - It is not the case that the story is [attr-42]
          - both of the following are true:
            - The story is [attr-35]
            - The story is [attr-47]
    - both of the following are true:
      - either of the following is true:
        - both of the following are true:
          - The story is [attr-28]
          - It is not both of the following are true:
            - The story is [attr-33]
            - The story is [attr-30]
        - The story is [attr-5]
      - either of the following is true:
        - exactly one of the following is true:
          - The story is [attr-11]
          - The story is [attr-14]
        - both of the following are true:
          - The story is [attr-7]
          - It is not the case that the story is [attr-2]

Quick annotator checklist (practical steps)
- Step 1: Mark all simple labels that apply to the story from the Simple label definitions section.
- Step 2: For [attr-1], evaluate each nested clause in order. Treat “either”, “both”, and “exactly one” with their usual logical meanings. Pay special attention to the negations: phrases beginning with “It is not the case that” or “It is not both of the following are true” reverse the enclosed condition(s).
- Step 3: A story is [attr-1] only if the full top-level condition (the two main "both of the following are true" branches) is satisfied according to the nested structure shown above.

End notes
- This rewrite keeps every node ID and the full logical structure intact. Use the hierarchical layout to follow the logic stepwise when annotating.
