In a sunlit archive where labels bloom like roses along an ivy-covered trellis, this codebook unfurls its petals. Each bracketed sigil is a guardian of meaning; below you will find the same exact guardians and the same unbroken lattice of logical relationships, now described with the lavishness of a storyteller describing their cherished map. The pragmatics remain untouched — every node ID, every logical connective, every formulaic structure endures exactly as before; only the language that cradles them is dressed in finery.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if The story has a moral lesson — that luminous, guiding precept tucked into the narrative’s weave, a lesson meant to linger like the scent of jasmine after dusk.

[attr-12]
A story is [attr-12] if The story uses perfect aspect — the verb forms that cast events as completed or consequential, the grammatical talismans that tie past actions to present significance.

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if The story has a cliffhanger — a breath held on the edge of a precipice, where the tale pauses and the reader’s heartbeat is invited to keep the unanswered question company.

[attr-11]
A story is [attr-11] if The story has the theme Kindness — a recurring moral current of compassion and benevolence that runs through characters’ choices like a warm, sustaining river.

[attr-10]
A story is [attr-10] if The story is modern — fashioned in contemporary idioms or sensibilities, attuned to present-day rhythms and the glass-and-steel light of our era.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if The story has a flashback — a temporal bloom backward, where memory unfurls to show what shaped the present, like a sudden shutter revealing an earlier scene.

[attr-8]
A story is [attr-8] if The story is classic — carrying the cadence of traditional forms, timeless motifs, or enduring narrative architectures that feel rooted in the long lineage of storytelling.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if The story has more than 375 words — crossing the threshold where a narrative stretches beyond a brief whisper into a fuller, more elaborated utterance.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if The story has juxtaposition — the deliberate placing of contrasting elements side by side, so their differences sing like complementary colors on a painter’s palette.

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] if The story is lighthearted — buoyant in tone, playful in spirit, its mood as airy and bright as a breeze through sunlit curtains.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if all of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-2]
  - The story is [attr-3]
  (In other words, the tale must reach backward or cliff-edge outward — at least one of those dramatic gestures must be present.)
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-5]
  - The story is [attr-12]
  (Precisely one of these structural choices is in play: either the artful contrast of juxtaposition, or the temporal sheen of perfect aspect — but not both.)
- The story is not [attr-9]
  (The narrative’s tenor must not be purely carefree; richness here presumes a seriousness of tone.)
- At least one of the story's structural features is in the set { [attr-2], [attr-3], [attr-5] }
  (To be considered richly narrated, the story must display at least one of these marked structural traits that give it depth and texture.)

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-7]
  (First, it must already wear the mantle of a rich narrative, as defined above.)
- Both of the following are true:
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-11]
    - The story is [attr-4]
    (Secondly, the tale must embrace an ethical strand — either an explicit moral lesson or a central theme of kindness.)
  - The presence of [attr-10] equals the presence of [attr-8]
    (Finally, the existence of modern stylistic traits must be exactly matched by the presence of classic stylistic traits — a balanced equivalence, as if the narrative stands at once in contemporary light and in timeless shadow.)

Thus the garden of criteria stands as before, each rule a labelled vine on the same trellis; the relationships are preserved, the logic unaltered, and the explanations gilded for ease and delight.
