Codebook — Structured View
Purpose: Provide a clear, hierarchical representation of each annotation node and its logical relationships. Use this as a checklist when deciding whether a story satisfies a node.

1) Atomic nodes — basic labels
- [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] if the story is about the arts.

- [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
  - Definition: A story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD] if the story uses conditional mood.

- [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] if the story starts with a adjective.

- [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if the story is philosophical.

2) Compound nodes — logical combinations
- [CONDITIONAL-AND-NOT-START]
  - Qualification rule: A story is [CONDITIONAL-AND-NOT-START] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
    - The story is not [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]

- [ARTS-XOR-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - Qualification rule: A story is [ARTS-XOR-PHILOSOPHICAL] if exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
    - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]

- [COMPLEX-CRITERION]
  - Qualification rule: A story is [COMPLEX-CRITERION] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [CONDITIONAL-AND-NOT-START]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is in the set of topics that includes [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
      - The truth of [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] is equal to the truth of not [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]

3) Quick annotation checklist (how to decide)
- First, identify atomic properties:
  - Is the story about the arts? → [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
  - Does the story use conditional mood? → [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
  - Does the story start with an adjective? → [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - Is the story philosophical in style? → [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]

- Then evaluate compounds in order:
  - If the story both uses conditional mood and does not start with an adjective → tag [CONDITIONAL-AND-NOT-START].
  - If exactly one of “about the arts” or “philosophical” holds → tag [ARTS-XOR-PHILOSOPHICAL].
  - For [COMPLEX-CRITERION], mark true if:
    - the story meets [CONDITIONAL-AND-NOT-START], OR
    - both (it is within the topics that include [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]) AND (STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL’s truth equals the truth of not [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]).

Notes and reminders
- All logical relationships must be preserved exactly as listed above (Not, And, Or / both, exactly one, either).
- Do not alter node IDs — use the bracketed IDs verbatim when annotating.
- The phrase “the story is in the set of topics that includes [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]” is intentional: treat it as checking topic membership that covers [TOPIC-THE-ARTS].
