[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]  
A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if the tale carries, at its very heart, the theme Helping Others—like a lantern held aloft in darkness, guiding one soul to ease another’s burden.

[TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]  
A story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES] if the story is about mystical creatures—those moonlit beings and ancient wonders that drift through legend: fae and wyrms, spirits and shapeshifters, all breathing enchantment into the world of the page.

[STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]  
A story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if the story starts with a preposition—opening not with a name or a cry, but with a small, subtle hinge-word that swings the reader into place: *In*, *On*, *Under*, *Beyond*, and their kin.

[MYTHIC-BUT-NOT-ALTRUISTIC]  
A story is [MYTHIC-BUT-NOT-ALTRUISTIC] if both of the following are true:  
- The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES]  
- The story is not [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]  

In the old archivist’s tower—where vellum smelled of rain and ink seemed to remember every hand that ever held a quill—scribes used this mark for tales steeped in marvels, yet untouched by the gentle impulse of mercy. Such a story may glitter with magic, but it withholds the warmth of aid; its wonders remain wondrous, yet its heart does not turn toward helping.

[INVITING-OPENING]  
A story is [INVITING-OPENING] if both of the following are true:  
- The story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]  
- The story is not [MYTHIC-BUT-NOT-ALTRUISTIC]  

This is the seal the librarians reserved for doorways that feel welcoming: a beginning that steps forth with a preposition—quietly positioning the reader at the threshold—while avoiding the particular chill of [MYTHIC-BUT-NOT-ALTRUISTIC]. In other words, the opening beckons, and the story is not one that is simultaneously about mystical creatures and not about helping others.
