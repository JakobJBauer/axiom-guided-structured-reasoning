Think of this as a friendly cheat-sheet for tagging stories — relaxed in tone but strict in logic. Each entry tells you when to apply a tag; the node IDs in brackets are the exact labels you'll use.

[attr-4]
Call a story [attr-4] when it stretches beyond six paragraphs.

[attr-7]
Tag a story [attr-7] when its overall style fits the classic mold.

[attr-2]
Use [attr-2] for a story that leaves you hanging with a cliffhanger.

[attr-6]
Mark a story [attr-6] if the very first word is a preposition.

[attr-11]
Apply [attr-11] when the story carries the theme of deception.

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] when its tone or approach feels playful.

[attr-12]
Use [attr-12] if the story’s theme centers on helping others.

[attr-10]
Tag [attr-10] when the story foregrounds agency — characters acting with control or power.

[attr-3]
Mark [attr-3] when the story uses juxtaposition.

[attr-8]
Use [attr-8] for stories that take on a philosophical tone.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if either of the following is true:
- The story is both [attr-11] and not [attr-12]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-10]
  - The story is [attr-12]

In other words: a rich theme can come from deception that isn’t about helping others, or from a situation where exactly one of agency or helping-others is present — but not both.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is both [attr-2] and not [attr-9]
  - The story is both [attr-6] and [attr-5]

So, to earn the [attr-1] label it must be classic in style, and then either end on a non-playful cliffhanger, or begin with a preposition and qualify as a [attr-5].
