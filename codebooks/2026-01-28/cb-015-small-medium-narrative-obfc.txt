Imagine an annotator wandering through a gallery of short tales, labeling each piece like a curator who knows the rules by heart. As they move from frame to frame, the definitions below are their map — a set of compact, clear rules presented as if each one were a little story itself.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if the story has fewer than 160 words.
- Think of this as the doorway that separates flash fictions from longer yarns: if the text slips under the 160-word line, it gets the [attr-4] tag.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if the story has the theme Magic.
- Whenever a tale’s core revolves around spells, wonder, or the supernatural thread we call magic, the tag [attr-5] is pinned to it.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if the story uses wh-questions.
- This captures the curious voice in a piece — who, what, where, when, why, how — whenever those wh-questions appear, the story earns [attr-7].

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if the story has Checkhov's gun.
- If the tale places an element early that must later play a role — the classic narrative promise known as Checkhov's gun — then mark it as [attr-1].

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if the story has readability score above 96.1
- This is the clarity meter: when the readability score rises above 96.1, the story receives the [attr-2] label.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is not [attr-1]
- Imagine a magic that never promises payoffs — the kind that lingers like fog. If the tale’s heart is magic but it lacks Checkhov’s gun, then it settles into the [attr-3] category.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-4]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is not [attr-2]
    - The story is [attr-7]
- Picture a compact gem of a tale. To be crowned [attr-6], a story must be short, and then either it must be that mysterious, promise-free magic, or it must fall into a precise stylistic split: exactly one of unreadably raw clarity (not [attr-2]) or an inquisitive voice ([attr-7]) — but not both. That exactness preserves the balance that makes the label meaningful.

Keep this map in hand as you read and tag: each bracketed label is a lighthouse, and the logical threads between them are the steady ropes that hold the whole system together.
