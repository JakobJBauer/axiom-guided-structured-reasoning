Structured Codebook (preserving all node IDs and logical relationships)

Use this as a compact, annotator-focused reference. Each entry shows the node ID, a clear definition, and a precise, structured statement of the criteria you must check. Composite nodes preserve their logical operations exactly (Either, Both, Exactly one, Not). Do not change node IDs or logical relationships.

Basic atomic nodes
- [LOW-READABILITY]
  - Definition: A story is [LOW-READABILITY] if its readability score is below 86.4.
  - Annotation rule: mark this node when measured readability < 86.4.

- [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] if the story is about time travel.
  - Annotation rule: mark when time travel is a central topic.

- [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES] if the story is about seasonal changes.
  - Annotation rule: mark when seasonal change (e.g., transitions between seasons, climate-driven season motifs) is a topic.

- [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
  - Definition: A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if the story uses discourse markers.
  - Annotation rule: mark if the text contains discourse markers (e.g., however, therefore, meanwhile) used to signal relations between segments.

- [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] if the story starts with an adjective.
  - Annotation rule: mark when the very first token is an adjective.

- [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] if the story is about hidden treasures.
  - Annotation rule: mark when hidden treasure (discoveries, buried loot, secret caches) is a topic.

- [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception.
  - Annotation rule: mark when deception (lies, trickery, betrayal as a theme) is present.

- [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if the story has the theme Helping Others.
  - Annotation rule: mark when altruism or assistance to others is a theme.

- [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if the story starts with a preposition.
  - Annotation rule: mark when the very first token is a preposition.

- [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] if the story starts with an adverb.
  - Annotation rule: mark when the very first token is an adverb.

Composite nodes (preserve logical structure)

- [NARRATIVE-SURFACE]
  - Definition: A story is [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] if either of the following is true:
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
      - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
      - (Interpretation: the story starts with an adjective XOR starts with an adverb.)
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
      - Either of the following is true:
        - The story is [LOW-READABILITY]
        - The story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
      - (Interpretation: discourse markers are used, and either the story is low-readability or it starts with a preposition.)
  - Annotation checklist:
    - First, test the "Exactly one" branch:
      - Is the story starting token an adjective? If yes, does it NOT start with an adverb? If so, this sub-condition holds.
      - Or, is the story starting token an adverb and NOT an adjective? If so, this sub-condition holds.
    - If the "Exactly one" sub-condition holds, [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] is true.
    - Otherwise, test the "Both" branch:
      - Is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] true?
      - And is either [LOW-READABILITY] true or [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] true?
      - If both of those are true, then [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] is true.

- [INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE]
  - Definition: A story is [INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE] if both of the following are true:
    - Either of the following is true:
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
        - Exactly one of the following is true:
          - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
          - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
        - (Interpretation: time travel is a topic, and exactly one of the two themes—Deception or Helping Others—is present.)
      - Both of the following are true:
        - The story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
        - Both of the following are true:
          - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
          - The story is not [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
        - (Interpretation: seasonal changes and hidden treasures are topics, and time travel is explicitly not a topic.)
    - The story is [NARRATIVE-SURFACE]
  - Annotation checklist:
    - Confirm the second required condition:
      - Is [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] true? If not, [INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE] cannot be true.
    - If [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] is true, check the first (Either) condition:
      - Option A (Time-travel route):
        - Is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] true?
        - And is exactly one of [THEME-DECEPTION] or [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] true?
      - Option B (Seasonal + treasures route):
        - Is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES] true?
        - And is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] true?
        - And is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] false (i.e., not [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL])?
      - If either Option A or Option B is true, and [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] is true, then mark [INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE].

Quick annotation flow (practical order)
1. Label atomic nodes first (readability score, starting token type, presence of discourse markers, topics, themes).
2. Use those atomic labels to resolve [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] following its two-branch logic.
3. Finally, determine [INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE] by checking:
   - that [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] holds,
   - and that either the Time-travel route or the Seasonal+Treasure route (with the explicit "not [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]") is satisfied.

Notes and guidance
- "Exactly one" means XOR: one true and the other false.
- "Both of the following are true" means logical AND.
- "Either of the following is true" means logical OR.
- "The story is not [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]" explicitly negates that node.
- Preserve these logical operators precisely when you annotate—do not collapse or change them.
