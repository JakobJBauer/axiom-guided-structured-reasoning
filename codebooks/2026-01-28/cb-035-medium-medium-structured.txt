Codebook — Structured version

Purpose
- Provide a clear, organized reference for annotators to decide which labels apply to a story.
- Maintain exact node IDs and logical relationships. Do not add, remove, or change any nodes or logical operators.

1) Atomic (single-condition) labels
- These labels are decided by a single observable property of the story.

  - [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
    - Definition: A story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST] if the story is minimalist.

  - [HIGH-READABILITY]
    - Definition: A story is [HIGH-READABILITY] if the story has readability score above 96.1.

  - [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
    - Definition: A story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS] if the story uses superlative forms.

  - [THEME-GROWTH]
    - Definition: A story is [THEME-GROWTH] if the story has the theme Growth.

  - [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
    - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] if the story is about time travel.

  - [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
    - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] if the story is about hidden treasures.

2) Composite labels (logical combinations)
- These labels are defined by combining atomic labels with logical operators. Read each composite as: "A story is [LABEL] if ..." followed by the logical conditions.

  - [CLEAR-CONCISE]
    - A story is [CLEAR-CONCISE] if both of the following are true:
      - The story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
      - The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]

  - [EMPHATIC]
    - A story is [EMPHATIC] if both of the following are true:
      - The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
      - The story is not [STYLE-MINIMALIST]

  - [THEMATIC-ARC]
    - A story is [THEMATIC-ARC] if both of the following are true:
      - The story is [THEME-GROWTH]
      - Either of the following is true:
        - The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
        - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]

  - [COMPELLING]
    - A story is [COMPELLING] if both of the following are true:
      - The story is [CLEAR-CONCISE]
      - Either of the following is true:
        - The story is [EMPHATIC]
        - The story is [THEMATIC-ARC]

3) Quick annotation checklist (use this in order)
- Step 1 — Evaluate atomic properties:
  - Is the story minimalist? → mark [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
  - Is readability > 96.1? → mark [HIGH-READABILITY]
  - Does it use superlative forms? → mark [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
  - Is the theme Growth? → mark [THEME-GROWTH]
  - Is it about time travel? → mark [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
  - Is it about hidden treasures? → mark [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]

- Step 2 — Infer composite labels using the exact logical rules:
  - [CLEAR-CONCISE]: apply when both constituent atomic labels are present.
  - [EMPHATIC]: apply when [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS] is true and [STYLE-MINIMALIST] is false.
  - [THEMATIC-ARC]: apply when [THEME-GROWTH] is true and at least one of the listed topics is true.
  - [COMPELLING]: apply when [CLEAR-CONCISE] is true and at least one of ([EMPHATIC], [THEMATIC-ARC]) is true.

4) Notes and tips for consistent decisions
- Preserve the logical operators exactly as stated:
  - "both of the following are true" = logical AND
  - "Either of the following is true" = logical OR
  - "is not" = logical NOT
- Do not infer a composite label unless all required logical conditions are satisfied.
- Evaluate atomic labels first; then apply the composite rules to avoid mistakes.
