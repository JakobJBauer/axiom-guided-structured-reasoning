Interviewer: Let's walk through this codebook together. I’ll ask about each label, and you explain what it means. Sound good?

Responder: Sounds perfect — let’s do it.

Interviewer: What does [attr-3] mean?

Responder: A story is [attr-3] if the story is lighthearted.

Interviewer: Simple and clear. Next: [attr-2] — what is that?

Responder: A story is [attr-2] if the story starts with a adverb.

Interviewer: Got it. How about [attr-1]?

Responder: A story is [attr-1] if the story has more than 375 words.

Interviewer: And [attr-4]?

Responder: A story is [attr-4] if the story has the theme Humor.

Interviewer: What about topic labels like [attr-5]?

Responder: A story is [attr-5] if the story is about bygone eras.

Interviewer: Okay — now the more complex one. How is [attr-6] defined?

Responder: This one combines the others with logical structure. I’ll read it exactly as defined:

[attr-6]
A story is WHIMSY-RETRO-COMEDY if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-3]
- The story is [attr-4] and either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-5]
  - The story is [attr-2]

Interviewer: Let me paraphrase to check I understand: For a story to be [attr-6], it must be lighthearted, and it must have the humor theme plus at least one of these — either be about bygone eras or begin with an adverb. Is that accurate?

Responder: Exactly. The logical relationships are preserved: an AND between lighthearted and the rest, and within the “rest” an AND with the humor theme combined with an OR between the two options (bygone eras or starts-with-adverb).

Interviewer: Thanks — that keeps the structure clear and usable for annotation. Anything else we should note?

Responder: Just that each node label and the exact logical formulation have been preserved. Use those definitions as-is when deciding which labels apply to a story.
