Expert: A story is [attr-17] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-41]

Expert: A story is [attr-5] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-15]

- The story is [attr-18]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-9]
  - The story is [attr-8]

Interviewer: That one requires both inner conditions to hold — flashback and cliffhanger — plus many paragraphs.

Interviewer: [attr-20] — what's the rule?

Expert: A story is [attr-20] if either of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-25]
- The story is [attr-45]
- The story is [attr-47]

Interviewer: So any one of those three suffices.

Interviewer: [attr-14] uses "exactly one." Can you explain?

Expert: A story is [attr-14] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-26]

Expert: A story is [attr-7] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-30]
- The story is [attr-31]

Interviewer: [attr-4] — there’s a negation in there.

- The story is not [attr-16]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-24]
  - The story is [attr-15]

Interviewer: So it must have acceptable readability and be either short or long.

Expert: Correct.

Interviewer: [attr-1]?

Expert: A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-24]
- Exactly one of the following is true:

Interviewer: [attr-22]?

Expert: A story is [attr-22] if both of the following are true:

  - The story is [attr-38]
  - The story is [attr-17]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-20]
    - The story is [attr-4]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story uses [attr-44]
  - The story uses [attr-46]

Interviewer: So to satisfy [attr-2], you need (time-travel paradox OR magical story) AND complex structure AND (narrative voice OR engaging readability) AND (conditional mood OR perfect aspect).

Expert: Precisely. All those grouped conditions must be met according to the logical structure.

Interviewer: [attr-28]?

Expert: A story is [attr-28] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-13]
  - The story is [attr-19]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-36]

Interviewer: So it mixes one of those helper/kindness labels with one of those growth/problem labels.

Expert: Yes — one from each list.

Interviewer: Finally, [attr-21]?

Expert: A story is [attr-21] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-20]
- The story is not [attr-27]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-46]
  - The story is [attr-44]
