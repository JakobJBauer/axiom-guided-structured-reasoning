Overview
- Purpose: This codebook defines labels (nodes) used to classify stories.  
- How to read each entry:
  - Simple nodes state a single observable property.
  - Composite nodes list logical conditions that must hold (using "both", "either", and explicit negation).
- Note: All node IDs are shown in [attr-2] format and must be preserved exactly.

Atomic (single-condition) nodes
- [attr-14]
  - A story is [attr-14] if: The story is about time travel.

- [attr-12]
  - A story is [attr-12] if: The story is about hidden treasures.

- [attr-10]
  - A story is [attr-10] if: The story is philosophical.

- [attr-6]
  - A story is [attr-6] if: The story has more than 6 paragraphs.

- [attr-5]
  - A story is [attr-5] if: The story has readability score above 96.1.

- [attr-8]
  - A story is [attr-8] if: The story is classic.

- [attr-9]
  - A story is [attr-9] if: The story is humorous.

- [attr-13]
  - A story is [attr-13] if: The story is about mystical creatures.

Composite nodes (logical combinations)
- [attr-11]
  - A story is [attr-11] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-10]
    - The story is not [attr-9]

- [attr-7]
  - A story is [attr-7] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-8]
      - The story is [attr-9]

- [attr-1]
  - A story is [attr-1] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-12]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-14]
      - The story is not [attr-10]

- [attr-3]
  - A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-11]
    - Either of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-1]
      - The story is [attr-13]

- [attr-4]
  - A story is [attr-4] if both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-3]
    - The story is [attr-6]

Quick annotator checklist
- Verify atomic labels first (topics, styles, counts, readability).
- Evaluate composite labels only after confirming their component nodes.
- For “not” conditions, ensure the negated node does not apply before assigning the composite label.
- Preserve the exact node IDs when recording labels.
