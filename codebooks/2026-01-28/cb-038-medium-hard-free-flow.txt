Here’s the same codebook, rewritten in a more natural, conversational flow while keeping every logical connection and every node ID exactly as they were.

[STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
We call a story [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] when it simply reads as lighthearted.

[HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]
A story is tagged [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN] if it contains Chekhov’s gun — that detail or object that was planted earlier and becomes important later.

[HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
If a story leaves you hanging at the end, it’s marked [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER].

[THEME-HARDSHIP]
When a story’s central theme is hardship, it gets the label [THEME-HARDSHIP].

[THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
If the story revolves around helping others, we call it [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS].

[THEME-DECEPTION]
A story that centers on deception is tagged [THEME-DECEPTION].

[THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
When the driving theme is figuring things out and overcoming puzzles or obstacles, the story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING].

[THEMATIC-CONFLICT]
A story is [THEMATIC-CONFLICT] when exactly one of these is true:
- The story is [THEME-HARDSHIP]
- The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]

So, pick one of those themes and only one — that exclusive choice is what makes the conflict thematic.

[TONE-CONFLICTED]
Call a story [TONE-CONFLICTED] when both of these things happen:
- The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEMATIC-CONFLICT]
  - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]

In plain terms: it feels lighthearted on the surface, yet it either carries a single-theme conflict (hardship vs. deception) or it’s driven by problem-solving — and both conditions together create that tonal tension.

[PLOT-DRIVEN]
A story is [PLOT-DRIVEN] when both of these hold:
- The story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
  - The story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]

So a plot-driven tale uses planted elements like Chekhov’s gun and pairs that with one — and only one — of problem-solving or a cliffhanger.

[MORAL-ARC]
We call a story [MORAL-ARC] if either of these two situations applies:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - The story is not [THEME-DECEPTION]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
  - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]

In short: the moral arc shows up when helping others is central and not paired with deception, or when helping others and problem-solving come together.

[COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]
A story qualifies as [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] if either of these broader configurations is met:

- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [TONE-CONFLICTED]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [PLOT-DRIVEN]
    - The story is [MORAL-ARC]

  (So one path to complexity is a tone that’s conflicted, combined with plot-driven mechanics and a moral arc.)

- All of the following are true:
  - The story is not [TONE-CONFLICTED]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [PLOT-DRIVEN]
    - The story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
  - The story is not both of the following:
    - The story is [THEME-HARDSHIP]
    - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]

  (The other path: even without tonal conflict, the story is either plot-driven or ends on a cliffhanger, and it does not simultaneously carry both hardship and deception as themes.)

That’s the full set — the same logical structure and node IDs, expressed in a smoother, conversational way so it’s easier to read while remaining precise for annotation and reasoning.
