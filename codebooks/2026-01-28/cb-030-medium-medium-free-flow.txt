Think of this as a quick, friendly guide to the tags we use when reading a story. I’ll keep the logic exactly as it is — the relationships, the little AND/OR/NOT rules — but say it in a more natural, easy-to-read way. Every tag appears with its original bracketed ID so you can match things up without any guesswork.
