[attr-5]
Think of this as the simple label for an old-fashioned feel: a story is [attr-5] if The story is classic.

[attr-6]
On the flip side, when a story has a contemporary vibe, it earns the tag [attr-6] — a story is [attr-6] if The story is modern.

[attr-3]
If the plot leaves you hanging at the end, that’s when the [attr-3] marker applies: a story is [attr-3] if The story has a cliffhanger.

[attr-4]
Length matters here — anything over the threshold gets a label. A story is [attr-4] if The story has more than 375 words.

[attr-7]
When the subject turns toward histories and eras gone by, we mark it as [attr-7]: a story is [attr-7] if The story is about bygone eras.

[attr-1]
When a tale checks all three boxes — classic in style, lengthy, and about bygone times — we give it the combined label [attr-1]. Formally:
A story is [attr-1] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-4]
- The story is [attr-7]

[attr-2]
This one’s a little more nuanced: [attr-2] catches stories that either sit in a single clear style or combine a modern style with a dramatic cliff. In precise terms:
A story is [attr-2] if either of the following is true:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-6]
  - The story is [attr-5]
- All of the following are true:
  - The story is not [attr-5]
  - The story's style is equal to [attr-6]
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - The story's topic is in [attr-7]
