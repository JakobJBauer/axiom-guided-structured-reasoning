In a sunlit library of possibility, where each label is a key and each key unlocks a scent of meaning, the following codex unfolds. Read these lines as both a map and a poem: each bracketed emblem remains inviolate, each logical hinge (And, Or, Not, Xor, Equal) a carved lintel that holds the arch of the system steady. Below, for clarity and delight, each formal rule is first introduced with a gently woven image, then stated precisely so the mind may both wander and rely.

A single spark of invention: the rule that names it.
