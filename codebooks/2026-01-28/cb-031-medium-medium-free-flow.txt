Think of this as a friendly guide to the tags we use when labeling stories — written in a more natural voice but keeping every rule exactly as it was.

[LOW-READABILITY]
Call a story [LOW-READABILITY] when its readability score falls below 86.4.

[STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if the story is philosophical.

[STYLE-MODERN]
A story is [STYLE-MODERN] if the story is modern.

[USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
A story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS] if the story uses superlative forms.

[TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
A story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS] if the story is about bygone eras.

[THEME-MAGIC]
A story is [THEME-MAGIC] if the story has the theme Magic.

[TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
A story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] if the story is about time travel.

[HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
A story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON] if the story has a moral lesson.

[THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
A story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] if the story has the theme Problem-Solving.

[TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS]
A story is [TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
- The story is [THEME-MAGIC]

So [TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS] picks stories that sit squarely in either time travel or magic — but not both.

[DIDACTIC-BYGONE]
A story is [DIDACTIC-BYGONE] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-BYGONE-ERAS]
- The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
- The story is not [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]

That means a didactic bygone story must be about past eras, carry a moral, and avoid superlatives.

[COMPLEX-ARC]
A story is [COMPLEX-ARC] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [TIME-MAGIC-NEXUS]
- The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
- The story is not [LOW-READABILITY]

In plain terms: a [COMPLEX-ARC] blends either time travel or magic (but not both), centers on problem-solving, and maintains a readability score at or above the 86.4 cutoff.
