Notes for annotators (brief, to aid structured thinking)
- Treat atomic nodes as measurable facts (readability thresholds, word count, grammatical starts, stylistic tags).
- Evaluate compound nodes by following the exact nested logical bullets — do not shortcut or assume.
- When a condition says "Exactly one of the following is true," ensure mutual exclusivity: mark true only if exactly one child node is present.
- When a condition uses "not," interpret as the strict negation of that child node.
