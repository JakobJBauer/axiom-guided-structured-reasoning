Think of this as a friendly guide to the tags we use — each label is short, but its meaning is precise. Below you'll find each node and a smooth explanation of when to apply it, written in a natural voice while keeping all the logical rules exactly as they are.

[STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if the story is philosophical.

[HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
A story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY] if the story has a story within a story.

[USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
A story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD] if the story uses conditional mood.

[HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
A story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] if the story has circular narrative structure.

[TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
A story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] if the story is about cultural traditions.

[SHORT-STORY]
A story is [SHORT-STORY] if the story has fewer than 160 words.

[TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
A story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES] if the story is about seasonal changes.

[LOW-READABILITY]
A story is [LOW-READABILITY] if the story has readability score below 86.4.

[INNER-CONDITIONAL]
When a piece contains a nested tale and that inner tale speaks in hypotheticals, we give it this label. Formally:
A story is [INNER-CONDITIONAL] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
- The story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]

[PHILOS-CIRCULAR-XOR]
This tag catches a precise intersection: it wants either the philosophical tone or the circular shape — but not both — and it also insists that shortness and low readability line up. In plain terms:
A story is [PHILOS-CIRCULAR-XOR] if both of the following are true:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - The story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
- The truth value of the following are equal:
  - [SHORT-STORY]
  - [LOW-READABILITY]

[THEMATIC-IN]
We group stories under this tag when their subject fits one of a couple of related themes. Precisely:
A story is [THEMATIC-IN] if the story's topic is in the set:
- [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
- [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]

[COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]
This is the label for pieces that combine structural complexity with a clear topical focus and enough length to matter. In other words:
A story is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] if all of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [INNER-CONDITIONAL]
  - The story is [PHILOS-CIRCULAR-XOR]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [THEMATIC-IN]
  - The story is not [SHORT-STORY]

That’s the full set — same logical relationships, just laid out in an easier-to-read, conversational way so you can apply the tags confidently.
