[attr-2]
When we tag a story with [attr-2], we mean it: the narrative loops back on itself in a circular way. The plot, structure, or timeline returns to its starting point, creating that distinct roundabout feeling.

[attr-11]
A story gets the [attr-11] label when kindness is a central theme—when acts of generosity, compassion, or benevolence drive meaning or character choices.

[attr-3]
Use [attr-3] when a story places contrasting elements side by side—ideas, images, tones, or scenes that highlight each other through contrast.

[attr-12]
If the story revolves around secret caches, lost riches, or buried meanings—literal or metaphorical—mark it as [attr-12].

[attr-5]
We call a story [attr-5] when its readability score falls below 86.4. It implies denser, more complex prose or structure.

[attr-9]
Label a work [attr-9] when it leans into ideas and reflections, posing big questions or exploring concepts in a contemplative way.

[attr-8]
A story is [attr-8] if its style feels contemporary—in voice, themes, or technique—reflecting modern sensibilities.

[attr-10]
Tag [attr-10] when deception is a core theme—lies, trickery, misdirection, or duplicity shape the narrative or character dynamics.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if its readability score is above 96.1, suggesting clear, accessible prose.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-8]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-9]
  - The story is [attr-3]
- The story is not [attr-2]
In other words, it’s a modern piece that either thinks philosophically or plays with juxtaposition, but it doesn’t loop back into a circular narrative.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-11]
- The story is [attr-10]
- The story is [attr-6]
This captures those morally mixed stories where kindness and deception coexist within a modern, philosophical or juxtaposing framework.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is [attr-12]
So a [attr-1] combines moral ambiguity (kindness tangled with deception inside that modern-philosophical/juxtaposed form) with either a precise readability condition—one score category but not both—or with a focus on hidden treasures.
