[attr-10]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-10] iff its total word count is strictly less than 160 words.

[attr-17]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-17] iff the story’s principal theme is Kindness.

[attr-14]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-14] iff the story’s principal theme is Helping Others.

[attr-18]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-18] iff the story’s principal theme is Problem-Solving.

[attr-12]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-12] iff the narrative tone or approach is philosophical.

[attr-5]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-5] iff a readability metric for the story exceeds 96.1.

[attr-13]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-13] iff the narrative style is playful.

[attr-15]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-15] iff the story’s theme is Humor.

[attr-11]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-11] iff the story’s style is humorous.

[attr-4]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-4] iff the narrative contains an embedded or nested story (a story-within-a-story).

[attr-19]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-19] iff the subject matter concerns mystical creatures.

[attr-3]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-3] iff the narrative includes a deliberate red herring (a misleading clue or distraction).

[attr-6]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-6] iff both of the following are true (logical conjunction):
- The story is [attr-17]
- The story is [attr-14]
(Conjunction: both predicates must hold simultaneously.)

[attr-7]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-7] iff exactly one of the following is true (Xor):
- The story is [attr-13]
- The story is [attr-11]
(Xor denotes exclusivity: exactly one operand is true.)

[attr-16]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-16] iff the story’s dominant theme is a member of the set { [attr-17], [attr-14], [attr-18] }.
(Use the In operator to test membership among those theme nodes.)

[attr-1]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-1] iff the following Equal relationship holds:
- The presence of [attr-12] Equal the presence of [attr-11]
(Equality here indicates parity: both styles are present, or both are absent.)

[attr-8]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-8] iff both of the following conditions are true (logical conjunction):
- The story is [attr-19]
- The story is ([attr-4] And [attr-12])
(This is a nested And: the story must both involve mystical creatures and simultaneously include an embedded story that is philosophical.)

[attr-2]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-2] iff all of the following conditions are met:
- Either of the following is true (Or):
  - The story is [attr-6]
  - The story is [attr-18]
- Exactly one of the following is true (Xor):
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - The story is [attr-4]
- The story is Not [attr-10] Or the story is [attr-5]
(Interpretation: the arc requires either a combined kindness/helping theme or a problem-solving theme; it requires an exclusive presence of either a red herring or an embedded story; and it excludes short stories unless they meet HIGH-READABILITY.)

[attr-9]
Definition: A story satisfies [attr-9] iff both of the following top-level conditions are true (logical conjunction):
- The story is ([attr-2] And [attr-1])
- The story is ([attr-16] And (either of the following is true (Or):
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-8]))
(Structure note: this node composes multiple logical operators — And at the top level, an Or branch inside a thematic conjunction — and it references In, Equal, Not, and Xor through its subordinate nodes to define a deep, recommendable composition.)
