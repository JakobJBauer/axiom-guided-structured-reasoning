Overview — how to use this codebook
- Purpose: Define clear, testable labels (nodes) for annotating stories.
- Reading rules:
  - Each node ID appears exactly in [BRACKET] form; treat it as an atomic predicate (e.g., “The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]”).
  - Composite nodes state logical conditions using:
    - “Both of the following are true:” (logical AND)
    - “Either of the following is true:” (logical OR)
    - “Exactly one of the following is true:” (exclusive OR)
    - “All of the following are true:” (universal AND)
    - Negation is expressed with “not”
  - Do not change node IDs or the logical relationships when applying these rules.

Composite nodes — structured definitions and decision trees
- [JUX-PREP-CLASH]
  - A story is [JUX-PREP-CLASH] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
    2. Either of the following is true:
       - The story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]
       - The story is [SHORT-STORY]
  - Practical note: This captures juxtaposition that coincides with a prepositional start or with being very short.

- [JUXTAPOSED-SUPERLATIVE]
  - A story is [JUXTAPOSED-SUPERLATIVE] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [JUX-PREP-CLASH]
    2. Exactly one of the following is true:
       - The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
       - The story is [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
  - Practical note: This refines [JUX-PREP-CLASH] by requiring a mutually exclusive choice between superlatives and a minimalist style.

- [ARTISTIC-PHILOSOPHY]
  - A story is [ARTISTIC-PHILOSOPHY] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
    2. Either of the following is true:
       - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
       - The story is [JUXTAPOSED-SUPERLATIVE]
  - Practical note: This labels arts-focused stories that are either philosophical in tone or employ the juxtaposed-superlative pattern.

- [HUMOROUS-HYBRID]
  - A story is [HUMOROUS-HYBRID] if both of the following are true:
    1. Either of the following is true:
       - The story is [THEME-HUMOR]
       - The story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
    2. All of the following are true:
       - The story is not [STYLE-MINIMALIST]
       - Exactly one of the following is true:
         - The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
         - The story is [USES-SUPERLATIVE-FORMS]
  - Practical note: This captures humor-oriented pieces that are not minimalist and that choose exactly one of two expressive modes (lighthearted vs. superlative).

- [ALTRUISTIC-CONTRACTION]
  - A story is [ALTRUISTIC-CONTRACTION] if either of the following is true:
    - Option A (conjunctive):
      - Both of the following are true:
        1. The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]
        2. Either of the following is true:
           - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
           - The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
    - Option B (exclusive choice):
      - Exactly one of the following is true:
        - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
        - The story is [THEME-HARDSHIP]
  - Practical note: This node groups morally framed kindness/helping narratives with an alternate mutually exclusive pairing of deception vs. hardship.

- [COMPLEX-ARTFUL-STORY]
  - A story is [COMPLEX-ARTFUL-STORY] if both of the following are true:
    1. Either of the following is true:
       - Sub-option 1 (conjunction):
         - Both of the following are true:
           - The story is [ARTISTIC-PHILOSOPHY]
           - The story is [ALTRUISTIC-CONTRACTION]
       - Sub-option 2 (exclusive choice):
         - Exactly one of the following is true:
           - The story is [HUMOROUS-HYBRID]
           - The story is [TOPIC-GIANT-CREATURES]
    2. Either of the following is true:
       - Pair A:
         - Both of the following are true:
           - The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
           - The story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
       - Pair B:
         - Both of the following are true:
           - The story is [SHORT-STORY]
           - The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]
  - Practical note: This final composite identifies stories that combine an artful/affective core (either the artful-philosophical + altruistic axis or an exclusive choice between humorous hybrid vs. giant-creature focus) with one of two structural/readability outcomes (time-travel circularity, or short + highly readable).

Quick annotation checklist (practical workflow)
- Step 1: Mark all atomic nodes that apply (use the exact [NODE-ID] form).
- Step 2: Evaluate composite nodes in bottom-up order:
  - Resolve [JUX-PREP-CLASH] → then [JUXTAPOSED-SUPERLATIVE] → [ARTISTIC-PHILOSOPHY]
  - Resolve humor cluster: [HUMOROUS-HYBRID]
  - Resolve altruism cluster: [ALTRUISTIC-CONTRACTION]
  - Finally evaluate [COMPLEX-ARTFUL-STORY] using the results above plus structural nodes.
- Step 3: Apply negation exactly as written (e.g., “The story is not [STYLE-MINIMALIST]” must be satisfied where specified).
- Step 4: When “Exactly one of the following is true” appears, ensure exclusivity — confirm that only one of the listed sub-nodes holds.

Reminder
- Do not change node IDs, logical connectors, or add/remove nodes. This document reorganizes the presentation for clarity only; the underlying logic is unchanged.
