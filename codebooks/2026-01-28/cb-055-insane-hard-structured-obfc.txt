Codebook — Structured Reference
Purpose: A compact, hierarchical presentation of the annotation rules. Each node is listed with its exact logical test. Node IDs are preserved in [attr-1] form. Logical operators (Not, And, Or, Either, Both, Exactly one, All) and relationships are unchanged; they are shown as clear, indented conditions so annotators can reason step-by-step.

Usage Notes (for annotators)
- Read each node’s conditions top-to-bottom and evaluate the required subnodes exactly as written.
- Preserve logical operators when combining labels: “either” = inclusive OR, “both/all” = AND, “exactly one” = XOR, “not” = negation.
- Multi-level nodes reference other node IDs; determine those referenced nodes before concluding the parent node’s value.
- The structure above mirrors the original logical intent; use this as a stepwise checklist during annotation.

If you want, I can also produce a compact decision flow (tree) per high-level composite node to guide step-by-step annotation decisions.
