Interviewer: Let's go through this codebook line by line. First, what does [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD] mean?

Expert: A story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD] if the story uses conditional mood.

Interviewer: Simple enough. And [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]?

Expert: A story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] if the story uses perfect aspect.

Interviewer: What about themes—what does [THEME-DECEPTION] capture?

Expert: A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception.

Interviewer: And structural features—what is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]?

Expert: A story is [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER] if the story has a cliffhanger.

Interviewer: Now we’re getting to the composite nodes. Explain [COMPLEX-DECEPTION].

Expert: Sure. A story is [COMPLEX-DECEPTION] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
- The story is not [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
  - The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]

Interviewer: Let me double-check. So for [COMPLEX-DECEPTION], the story must have the deception theme, must not have a cliffhanger, and must use at least one of conditional mood or perfect aspect. Is that correct?

Expert: Exactly. That restates the same logical structure.

Interviewer: Next: [ASPECTUAL-AMBIVALENCE]. How is that defined?

Expert: A story is [ASPECTUAL-AMBIVALENCE] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
  - The story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]
- The story is not both of the following:
  - The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
  - The story is [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD]

Interviewer: So [ASPECTUAL-AMBIVALENCE] means the story uses one of those two aspect/mood features, but not both at the same time. Correct?

Expert: Correct. The phrasing “Either of the following is true” plus “not both of the following” enforces that exactly one of [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] or [USES-CONDITIONAL-MOOD] holds.

Interviewer: Finally, tell me about [AMBIGUOUS-DECEPTION-NARRATIVE].

Expert: A story is [AMBIGUOUS-DECEPTION-NARRATIVE] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [COMPLEX-DECEPTION]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [ASPECTUAL-AMBIVALENCE]
  - The story is not [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]

Interviewer: To paraphrase: to qualify as [AMBIGUOUS-DECEPTION-NARRATIVE], a story must already meet the criteria for [COMPLEX-DECEPTION], and additionally must either satisfy the exclusive-aspect condition ([ASPECTUAL-AMBIVALENCE]) or still be one that is not [HAS-A-CLIFFHANGER]. Right?

Expert: Yes. That preserves the original logical relationships exactly: [AMBIGUOUS-DECEPTION-NARRATIVE] requires [COMPLEX-DECEPTION], and then one of the two listed alternatives must hold.

Interviewer: Great. That preserves the structure while making the logic clearer in a conversational way.

Expert: Precisely—no node IDs, logical operators, or relationships were altered; we only explained them in an interview-style transcript for readability.
