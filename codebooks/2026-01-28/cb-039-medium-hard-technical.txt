Codebook — formal node definitions and logical specifications

Definitions below specify predicate conditions for story-level annotation. Each entry defines the predicate [NODE] such that: a story satisfies [NODE] if and only if the listed conditions hold. All node identifiers are preserved verbatim. Logical operators (Not, And, Or, xor, equals, and not) and the original compositional structure are retained.

- The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] xor [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]

[STRUCTURED-DECEPTION]
Definition: A story is [STRUCTURED-DECEPTION] if both of the following are true:

  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
    - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN] xor [THEME-AGENCY]
    - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION] and not [THEME-AGENCY]

[COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]
Definition: A story is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [STRUCTURED-DECEPTION]
- Not both of the following are true:
  - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] equals true
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] equals false

Notes for annotators and automated systems:
- Treat each line as a logical predicate: evaluate atomic predicates first (e.g., [STARTS-WITH-NOUN], [THEME-DECEPTION]), then apply the specified boolean composition.
- The operator “xor” denotes exclusive-or (true when exactly one operand is true).
- The phrase “and not” denotes conjunction with logical negation of the second operand.
- The phrases “equals true” and “equals false” are explicit equality checks and must be evaluated as written.
- Maintain the nesting and ordering of conditions when implementing these predicates to preserve intended semantics.
