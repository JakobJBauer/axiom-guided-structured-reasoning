Imagine a small, secret garden inside every story — a place where labels bloom like flowers and rules hum like bees. Walk with me through that garden. I will introduce you to each plant by its true name, and then, like a careful botanist, repeat the exact definition that anchors it in our taxonomy. The relationships between these plants are important: some grow only when others are present, and some stand alone. I will not alter those relationships; I will only tell their tale in a voice that invites you in.

First, there are simple, single-sense traits — the bright, obvious blossoms anyone can spot.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if the story is playful

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if the story is modern

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if the story starts with a adjective

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if the story uses discourse markers

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if the story has Checkhov's gun

These are the elemental traits: playful, modern, beginning with an adjective, peppered with discourse markers, or holding a literary promise like Chekhov’s gun. Each one stands alone, a single trait that can be observed.

Now imagine two plants entwined, a pairing that only flourishes when both partners are present. This is how certain narrative moments come to life — not by one trait, but by the company it keeps.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-4]

The [attr-3] is a duet: the story must be modern, and it must begin with an adjective. Only when these two conditions meet does this particular bloom appear.

Next, picture a more lively, layered arrangement: a structure that becomes engaging only when it either dresses itself playfully or uses discourse markers — and, crucially, only if Chekhov’s gun is present. The parts combine in a precise way, like a recipe where one of two ingredients must be chosen, and another is mandatory.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is either [attr-6] or [attr-7]
- The story is [attr-2]

So the [attr-1] arises when a story chooses between playfulness or discourse markers — and, in either case, includes a promise in the form of Chekhov’s gun. That conjunction is the hinge: choose one of the two stylistic modes, and ensure the narrative promise exists, and you have an engaging structure.

These rules are the map of that garden: the single petals, the paired vines, and the compound arrangements. Keep the labels as they are, and follow the logic exactly. Read them aloud if you like — they’re small spells that help annotators and readers recognize how stories are built.
