Interviewer: Let’s go through this codebook together. First, what does [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] mean?

Respondent: Simple. A story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT] if the story has circular narrative structure.

Interviewer: And the basic theme and style labels?

Respondent: Sure — short and direct.
- A story is [THEME-KINDNESS] if the story has the theme Kindness.
- A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception.
- A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if the story is philosophical.
- A story is [STYLE-MODERN] if the story is modern.
- A story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] if the story has juxtaposition.
- A story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] if the story is about hidden treasures.

Interviewer: How are readability categories defined?

Respondent:
- A story is [LOW-READABILITY] if the story has readability score below 86.4.
- A story is [HIGH-READABILITY] if the story has readability score above 96.1.

Interviewer: Now the composite labels — can you explain [MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA]?

Respondent: Yes. [MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA] is true when all of the following are true:
- The story is [STYLE-MODERN]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
- The story is not [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]

Interviewer: So it requires modern style, plus either philosophical or juxtaposition, and explicitly excludes circular narratives. Got it. What about [MORAL-AMBIVALENCE]?

Respondent: [MORAL-AMBIVALENCE] holds if all of the following are true:
- The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
- The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
- The story is [MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA]

Interviewer: That means moral ambivalence combines both themes and that specific stylistic condition. Clear. The most complex one is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] — how is that computed?

Respondent: [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] is true when both of the following are true:
- The story is [MORAL-AMBIVALENCE]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [LOW-READABILITY]
    - The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]
  - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]

Interviewer: Quick clarification — when you say “Exactly one of the following is true,” you mean XOR: the story must be either [LOW-READABILITY] or [HIGH-READABILITY], but not both?

Respondent: Correct. “Exactly one” enforces exclusivity between [LOW-READABILITY] and [HIGH-READABILITY].

Interviewer: To summarize: atomic nodes define single properties like theme, style, topic, and readability thresholds. [MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA] combines modern style with either philosophical or juxtaposition and excludes circular form. [MORAL-AMBIVALENCE] requires both kindness and deception themes plus that combined modern/philo/juxta condition. And [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] layers on [MORAL-AMBIVALENCE] plus either an exclusive readability state or the hidden-treasures topic. Is that an accurate high-level wrap-up?

Respondent: Exactly. All node IDs and logical relationships remain as stated: no nodes added or removed, and all logical operators (Either, Exactly one, not, both) are preserved.
