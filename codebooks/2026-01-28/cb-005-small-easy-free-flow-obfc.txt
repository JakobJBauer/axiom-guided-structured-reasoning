Think of this as a friendlier, more conversational tour through the same codebook — every label and logical link stays exactly where it was, only the wording around them relaxes into a more natural voice.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if the story uses discourse markers. In other words, when a narrative relies on connective words and phrases — “however,” “meanwhile,” “on the other hand,” and the like — we mark it with this label.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if the story has juxtaposition. If the story places contrasting elements side by side to highlight differences or surprising similarities, that’s what this tag captures.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if the story is about mystical creatures. Use this whenever the narrative centers on beings of myth, magic, or the supernatural.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if the story has a Red Herring. This one flags a deliberate misdirection or false lead woven into the plot.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if the story is about giant creatures. When enormous beings are a primary focus — that’s when this label applies.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-6]
- The story is [attr-4]
So, when mystical creatures are central and the narrative explicitly sets contrasting elements side by side, the story fits this combined category.

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-3]
This label goes on tales that focus on giant creatures and also include a red herring — the large-scale focus plus an intentional plot mislead.

That’s it — same precise structure and logic, just written in a smoother, more conversational tone so it’s easier to read and use while you annotate.
