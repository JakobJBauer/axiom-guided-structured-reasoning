Interviewer: Let's walk through this codebook together. First, can you tell me what [attr-7] means?

Expert: Sure. The formal definition is:
- "A story is [attr-7] if The story has a story within a story."

In plain terms: mark [attr-7] true when the narrative contains an embedded tale — a story told inside the main story.

Interviewer: And [attr-11]?

Expert: The formal line is:
- "A story is [attr-11] if The story has the theme Magic."

So, tag [attr-11] when magic is a theme in the story.

Interviewer: How about [attr-6]?

Expert: Formally:
- "A story is [attr-6] if The story has a flashback."

In practice: flag [attr-6] when a portion of the narrative moves back in time to earlier events.

Interviewer: What's [attr-12]?

Expert: Formally:
- "A story is [attr-12] if The story is about the arts."

So use [attr-12] for stories focused on artistic subjects (painting, music, dance, etc.).

Interviewer: And [attr-10]?

Expert: Formally:
- "A story is [attr-10] if The story is minimalist."

Use [attr-10] for narratives that are stylistically spare or minimal.

Interviewer: What does [attr-8] represent?

Expert: The formal definition:
- "A story is [attr-8] if The story has circular narrative structure."

That means the plot or sequence loops back to where it began — mark [attr-8] when that structure is present.

Interviewer: Now we get to some compound definitions. Explain [attr-5].

Expert: The exact definition is:
- "A story is [attr-5] if exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-6]"

So [attr-5] is true when exactly one of those two devices appears — either an embedded story or a flashback, but not both.

Interviewer: And [attr-4]?

Expert: The formal statement:
- "A story is [attr-4] if the truth value of [attr-7] equals the truth value of [attr-8]"

In other words, [attr-4] is true when those two nodes share the same truth value — both present or both absent.

Interviewer: What's [attr-9]?

Expert: Formally:
- "A story is [attr-9] if the story's primary theme or topic is in the set {[attr-11], [attr-12]}"

That means mark [attr-9] when the story's primary classification is either magic-themed or about the arts.

Interviewer: The next one looks more complex: [attr-3]. Can you break it down exactly as defined?

Expert: Absolutely. The node is defined verbatim as:
- "A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
  - Either of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is [attr-4]
  - The story is not [attr-10] and (the story is [attr-8] or the story is [attr-6])"

So to mark [attr-3] true, two things must hold:
1. At least one of the device conditions holds: either [attr-5] is true or [attr-4] is true.
2. Additionally, the story must not be minimalist (i.e., not [attr-10]) and must have either a circular structure or a flashback (i.e., [attr-8] or [attr-6] is true).

Interviewer: Got it. What about [attr-1]?

Expert: The codebook states:
- "A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-9]
  - Either of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-3]
    - The story is [attr-10]"

So [attr-1] is true when the story belongs to the magic-or-arts set ([attr-9]) and, in addition, is either a complex-narrative-core or is minimalist in style.

Interviewer: Last one — [attr-2]. This looks like a final filter.

Expert: The precise definition:
- "A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-1]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - The story is not [attr-6]"

So to set [attr-2] true you need:
1. The story must already satisfy [attr-1].
2. Exactly one of the two conditions must hold: either [attr-4] is true, or the story does not have a flashback ([attr-6] is false). That "exactly one" means these two conditions cannot both be true or both false — precisely one must be true.

Interviewer: Thanks — that's a helpful walkthrough. Any final tips for annotators using this transcript-style codebook?

Expert: Keep these points in mind:
- Use the bracketed node IDs exactly as written when you annotate.
- Follow the logical relationships as stated: whenever a compound node refers to other nodes, evaluate those other nodes first.
- Remember the exact-mode operators: "exactly one" means XOR (exclusive or); "equals the truth value of" means strict equivalence.
- If you’re unsure about a node like [attr-3] or [attr-2], check each subcondition step by step: evaluate the inner nodes, then apply the outer combination.

Interviewer: Excellent. That keeps the logical structure intact and makes the rules easier to follow.
