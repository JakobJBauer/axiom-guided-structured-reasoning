[HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
When we tag a story with [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT], we mean it: the narrative loops back on itself in a circular way. The plot, structure, or timeline returns to its starting point, creating that distinct roundabout feeling.

[THEME-KINDNESS]
A story gets the [THEME-KINDNESS] label when kindness is a central theme—when acts of generosity, compassion, or benevolence drive meaning or character choices.

[HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
Use [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] when a story places contrasting elements side by side—ideas, images, tones, or scenes that highlight each other through contrast.

[TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
If the story revolves around secret caches, lost riches, or buried meanings—literal or metaphorical—mark it as [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES].

[LOW-READABILITY]
We call a story [LOW-READABILITY] when its readability score falls below 86.4. It implies denser, more complex prose or structure.

[STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
Label a work [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] when it leans into ideas and reflections, posing big questions or exploring concepts in a contemplative way.

[STYLE-MODERN]
A story is [STYLE-MODERN] if its style feels contemporary—in voice, themes, or technique—reflecting modern sensibilities.

[THEME-DECEPTION]
Tag [THEME-DECEPTION] when deception is a core theme—lies, trickery, misdirection, or duplicity shape the narrative or character dynamics.

[HIGH-READABILITY]
A story is [HIGH-READABILITY] if its readability score is above 96.1, suggesting clear, accessible prose.

[MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA]
A story is [MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [STYLE-MODERN]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
- The story is not [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
In other words, it’s a modern piece that either thinks philosophically or plays with juxtaposition, but it doesn’t loop back into a circular narrative.

[MORAL-AMBIVALENCE]
A story is [MORAL-AMBIVALENCE] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
- The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
- The story is [MODERN-PHILO-JUXTA]
This captures those morally mixed stories where kindness and deception coexist within a modern, philosophical or juxtaposing framework.

[COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]
A story is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [MORAL-AMBIVALENCE]
- Either of the following is true:
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [LOW-READABILITY]
    - The story is [HIGH-READABILITY]
  - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
So a [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] combines moral ambiguity (kindness tangled with deception inside that modern-philosophical/juxtaposed form) with either a precise readability condition—one score category but not both—or with a focus on hidden treasures.
