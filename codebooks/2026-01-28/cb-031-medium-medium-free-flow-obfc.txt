Think of this as a friendly guide to the tags we use when labeling stories — written in a more natural voice but keeping every rule exactly as it was.

[attr-4]
Call a story [attr-4] when its readability score falls below 86.4.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if the story is philosophical.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if the story is modern.

[attr-12]
A story is [attr-12] if the story uses superlative forms.

[attr-10]
A story is [attr-10] if the story is about bygone eras.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if the story has the theme Magic.

[attr-11]
A story is [attr-11] if the story is about time travel.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if the story has a moral lesson.

[attr-8]
A story is [attr-8] if the story has the theme Problem-Solving.

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] if exactly one of the following is true:
- The story is [attr-11]
- The story is [attr-7]

So [attr-9] picks stories that sit squarely in either time travel or magic — but not both.

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-10]
- The story is [attr-3]
- The story is not [attr-12]

That means a didactic bygone story must be about past eras, carry a moral, and avoid superlatives.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-9]
- The story is [attr-8]
- The story is not [attr-4]

In plain terms: a [attr-1] blends either time travel or magic (but not both), centers on problem-solving, and maintains a readability score at or above the 86.4 cutoff.
