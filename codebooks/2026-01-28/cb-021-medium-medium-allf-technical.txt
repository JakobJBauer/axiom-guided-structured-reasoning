Purpose: This codebook defines binary annotation predicates over narrative texts. Each predicate is identified by a unique node ID in square brackets. A story “is” a predicate when the predicate's condition is satisfied. Logical composition operators (either, both, exactly one, not) indicate Boolean relationships between predicates.

Definition: [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
- A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] iff the story's initial token is an adjective.

Definition: [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
- A story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] iff the story's initial token is a noun.

Definition: [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
- A story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] iff the story's overall style can be classified as lighthearted.

Definition: [STYLE-SURREAL]
- A story is [STYLE-SURREAL] iff the story's style exhibits surreal characteristics.

Definition: [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
- A story is [STYLE-HUMOROUS] iff the story's tone is humorous.

Definition: [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
- A story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING] iff the story contains the theme Problem-Solving.

Definition: [THEME-DECEPTION]
- A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] iff the story contains the theme Deception.

Definition: [START-TYPE-XOR]
- A story is [START-TYPE-XOR] if exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
- (Semantically: [START-TYPE-XOR] represents the exclusive disjunction of [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] and [STARTS-WITH-NOUN].)

Definition: [TONE-PLAYFUL]
- A story is [TONE-PLAYFUL] if either of the following is true:
  - The story's style is in the set { [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED], [STYLE-HUMOROUS] }
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [STYLE-SURREAL]
    - The story is not [THEME-DECEPTION]
- (Semantically: [TONE-PLAYFUL] is true when the style is lighthearted or humorous, or when the style is surreal provided deception is absent.)

Definition: [DECEPTION-OR-PROBLEM]
- A story is [DECEPTION-OR-PROBLEM] if either of the following is true:
  - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - The story is [THEME-PROBLEM-SOLVING]
- (Semantically: logical disjunction of the two theme predicates.)

Definition: [STYLE-EQUALITY]
- A story is [STYLE-EQUALITY] if the following equality holds:
  - [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] = [STYLE-HUMOROUS]
- (Semantically: [STYLE-EQUALITY] is true when [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] and [STYLE-HUMOROUS] have identical truth values for the given story.)

Definition: [COMPLEX-STORY]
- A story is [COMPLEX-STORY] if both of the following are true:
  - The story is [START-TYPE-XOR]
  - Exactly one of the following is true:
    - The story is [TONE-PLAYFUL]
    - The story is [DECEPTION-OR-PROBLEM]
- (Semantically: [COMPLEX-STORY] requires that the story's start-token classification is exclusive and that exactly one of the two higher-level conditions (playful tone vs. deception/problem theme) holds.)

Notes for annotators:
- Treat each predicate as a Boolean property evaluated against the full text.
- Preserve the exclusivity and equality semantics as specified.
- Do not alter node IDs, logical operators, or the composition structure when applying or extending these definitions.
