Codebook — Structured Edition

Purpose: Provide a clear, organized reference for annotators. Each node (ID in [attr-2]) defines a predicate about a story. The logical relationships (And, Or, Not, Xor, Equal) and node IDs are preserved exactly as in the original codebook.

1) Atomic predicates — simple, directly observable tags

    - The story is [attr-30]
    - The story is [attr-27]

- [attr-12]
  - A story is [attr-12] if exactly one (Xor) of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-14]
    - The story is [attr-9]

- [attr-13]
  - A story is [attr-13] if both of the following are true (And):
    - The story is [attr-10]
    - The story is [attr-15]

- [attr-16]
  - A story is [attr-16] if either of the following are true (Or):
    - The story is [attr-6]
    - The story is [attr-7]
    - The story is [attr-8]

- [attr-11]
  - A story is [attr-11] if either of the following are true (Or):
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is [attr-24]

- [attr-4]
  - A story is [attr-4] if Equal(the truth of [attr-24], the truth of [attr-25])

- [attr-1]
  - A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true (And):
    - The story is [attr-4]
    - Either of the following are true (Or):
      - The story is [attr-29]
      - The story is [attr-26]

- [attr-31]
  - A story is [attr-31] if both of the following are true (And):

    - Either of the following are true (Or):
      - The story is [attr-1]
      - The story is [attr-28]

4) Final compound type — full conjunction for complex annotation
- [attr-3]
  - A story is [attr-3] if all of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-31]
    - The story is [attr-17]
    - The story is [attr-36]
    - The story is [attr-16]
    - Not the story is [attr-18]
    - The story is [attr-12]
    - The story is [attr-13]
    - The story is [attr-11]

Notes for annotators (pragmatic guidance)
- Read each atomic predicate literally: these are the building blocks used by the composite nodes.
- For "Or" blocks: satisfying any listed sub-node makes the parent true.
- For "And" blocks: every listed sub-node must be true for the parent to hold.
- For "Xor": exactly one of the listed options must be true — not zero, not both.
- For "Equal(...)": follow the equality of truth values as specified.
- The phrase "Not the story is [attr-18]" must be interpreted as logical negation (the story must not be [attr-18]) when evaluating [attr-3].

This structured layout preserves all node IDs, logical operations, and relationships unchanged while organizing the content for easier, systematic annotation.
