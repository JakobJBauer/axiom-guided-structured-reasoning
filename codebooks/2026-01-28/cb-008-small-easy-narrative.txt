Imagine a dimly lit archive where stories are catalogued like rare artifacts — each label tells you not just what a tale is, but what it does in the world of meaning. Walk with me through a short tour of that archive; I’ll tell you the little signs we pin to these tales, and then hand you the exact rule that makes each sign stick.

First, there are tales braided from the practices and rituals of a people — the festivals, the rites, the recipes passed down by lantern-light. When such a tale takes center stage, we hang a ribbon on it to say where it belongs:
A story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] if the story is about cultural traditions.

Some tales carry a lamp to guide behavior — they teach, nudge, or warn. When a story leaves you with a lesson meant to shape choices or character, we mark it with this emblem:
A story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON] if the story has a moral lesson.

Then there are tales that open with a little rhythm, a cadence that shapes the whole sentence: an opening word that describes how the action unfolds, setting the tone from the very first breath. For those, we note:
A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] if the story starts with a adverb.

Magic also has its own corner in the archive — stories where the impossible hums as if it were ordinary. Whenever spells, enchantment, or the uncanny are central, we attach this flag:
A story is [THEME-MAGIC] if the story has the theme Magic.

Finally, there’s a special category reserved for the oldest, most instructive enchantments: tales that come from cultural roots, are threaded with magic, and also carry a moral to pass on. Think of a village elder telling a cautionary spell at the hearth — that combination is what unlocks the last label. The rule that bundles these three qualities is strict and exact; it only applies when every part is present:
A story is [TRADITIONAL-MAGIC-TEACHING] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
- The story is [THEME-MAGIC]
- The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]

In this archive, each label is precise and each rule is deliberate. Read the ribbons, check the badges, and you’ll know which stories teach tradition, which begin with a particular cadence, which weave magic into their threads, and which of them do all of these things at once.
