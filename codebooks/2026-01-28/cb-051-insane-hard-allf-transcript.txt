Interpretation: [STYLE-CATEGORY] holds when the story’s style matches any one of those five listed style nodes. It's a membership test — if the style is one of that set, [STYLE-CATEGORY] is true.

Interviewer: Explain [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-SET].

Expert: Formally: "A story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-SET] if the story's topic is In the set { [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-CREATURES], [TOPIC-MAGICAL-LANDS], [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES], [TOPIC-LOST-CIVILIZATIONS], [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] }"

Translation: This groups mystical or speculative topics. If the story’s topic is any of the listed ones, [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-SET] applies.

Interviewer: What about [THEME-CLUSTER]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [THEME-CLUSTER] if either of the following are true (Or):
- The story is [THEME-INNOVATION]
- The story is [THEME-GROWTH]
- The story is [THEME-HARDSHIP]
- The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
- The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
- The story is [THEME-MAGIC]
- The story is [THEME-HUMOR]"

Explanation: [THEME-CLUSTER] is true if the story has any one of those themes. It’s inclusive — any match activates the cluster.

Interviewer: [NARRATIVE-LENGTH-XOR]? That sounds specific.

Expert: Formally: "A story is [NARRATIVE-LENGTH-XOR] if exactly one (Xor) of the following is true:
- The story is [SHORT-STORY]
- The story is [LONG-STORY]"

Clarified: Use [NARRATIVE-LENGTH-XOR] when the story is either short or long, but not both. It enforces exclusivity: precisely one of those length categories must hold.

Interviewer: [READABILITY-AND-START]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [READABILITY-AND-START] if both of the following are true (And):
- The story is [LOW-READABILITY]
- The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]"

Plain: This composite requires both conditions: low readability and that the story begins with an adjective.

Interviewer: [STRUCTURAL-DEVICE]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [STRUCTURAL-DEVICE] if either of the following are true (Or):
- The story is [HAS-A-STORY-WITHIN-A-STORY]
- The story is [HAS-CIRCULAR-NARRATIVE-STRUCT]
- The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]"

Explanation: If the story uses any of those structural devices (a nested story, circular structure, or juxtaposition), then [STRUCTURAL-DEVICE] applies.

Interviewer: [MORAL-OR-GROWTH]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [MORAL-OR-GROWTH] if either of the following are true (Or):
- The story is [HAS-A-MORAL-LESSON]

Expert: Formally: "A story is [EQUAL-THEME-PRESENCE] if Equal(the truth of [THEME-GROWTH], the truth of [THEME-HARDSHIP])"

Translation: This uses the Equal operator: [EQUAL-THEME-PRESENCE] is true when [THEME-GROWTH] and [THEME-HARDSHIP] are either both true or both false — i.e., they have equal truth values.

Interviewer: [BALANCED-THEME]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [BALANCED-THEME] if both of the following are true (And):
- The story is [EQUAL-THEME-PRESENCE]
- Either of the following are true (Or):
  - The story is [THEME-KINDNESS]
  - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]"

Explanation: For [BALANCED-THEME] you need equality between growth and hardship (per [EQUAL-THEME-PRESENCE]) and also at least one of kindness or helping-others themes.

Interviewer: [THEME-SYNDROME]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [THEME-SYNDROME] if both of the following are true (And):
- The story is [THEME-CLUSTER]
- Either of the following are true (Or):
  - The story is [BALANCED-THEME]
  - The story is [THEME-INNOVATION]"

Plain: [THEME-SYNDROME] requires the story to match the theme cluster (one of the listed themes) and also either be balanced between growth/hardship plus kindness/helping-others, or specifically have the innovation theme.

Interviewer: And finally, the big one: [COMPLEX-STORY-TYPE]?

Expert: Formally: "A story is [COMPLEX-STORY-TYPE] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [THEME-SYNDROME]
- The story is [STYLE-CATEGORY]
- The story is [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-SET]
- The story is [STRUCTURAL-DEVICE]
- Not the story is [STYLE-CLASSIC]
- The story is [NARRATIVE-LENGTH-XOR]
- The story is [READABILITY-AND-START]
- The story is [MORAL-OR-GROWTH]"

Translation and checklist: This label is strict — all those conditions must hold simultaneously.
- The story must satisfy [THEME-SYNDROME] (thematic requirements we discussed).
- Its style must be one of the styles in [STYLE-CATEGORY].
- Its topic must be in [TOPIC-MYSTICAL-SET].
- It must use at least one structural device from [STRUCTURAL-DEVICE].
- It must NOT be [STYLE-CLASSIC] (explicit negation).
- It must be either short or long, exclusively ([NARRATIVE-LENGTH-XOR]).
- It must have low readability and start with an adjective ([READABILITY-AND-START]).
- And it must have a moral lesson or be about growth ([MORAL-OR-GROWTH]).

Interviewer: That helps a lot. A couple quick clarifying questions: when you recite the formal lines you’re keeping the exact wording, right?

Expert: Yes. Each formal definition I quoted is verbatim from the codebook. Those lines are the authoritative logical formulas. My plain-language explanations are just to make them easier to apply, but they do not alter any of the logical structure or node IDs.

Interviewer: Great. Anything else the annotators should keep in mind?

Expert: Two practical tips:
1. Always check the atomic tags first (those single-condition nodes like [THEME-MAGIC], [SHORT-STORY], etc.). They feed into composites.
2. When you evaluate composite nodes, match the logical operators exactly — Or means inclusive OR, And requires both, Xor requires exclusivity, Not negates, and Equal compares truth values. The composite definitions are deterministic if you compute them from the atomic truths.

Interviewer: Thanks — this transcript style makes the rules much more approachable while keeping the logic solid.

Expert: My pleasure. If you want, we can walk through an example story and apply the tags step by step.
