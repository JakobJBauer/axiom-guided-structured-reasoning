[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if the story is about cultural traditions.
Think of this tag as the home for stories that explore rituals, customs, festivals, or practices rooted in a community’s shared history—anything where culture and tradition are central to the narrative.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if the story has a moral lesson.
Use this when the tale clearly teaches or implies a lesson—an ethical takeaway or guiding principle the reader is meant to notice.

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if the story starts with a adverb.
This flags openings that begin with an adverbial word (for example, “Quietly,” “Suddenly,” or “Unfortunately,”) setting tone or pace right from the first word.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if the story has the theme Magic.
Tag stories where magic—wonder, supernatural forces, spells, or mystical elements—is a clear thematic thread.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-4]
- The story is [attr-3]
- The story is [attr-1]
When all three of those conditions line up—cultural tradition at the center, magic woven into the theme, and a moral lesson to take away—you’ve got a [attr-5] story: a folk or culturally rooted tale that uses the magical to teach something meaningful.
