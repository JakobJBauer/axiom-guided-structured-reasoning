Codebook — structured, clear, and ready for annotation

Purpose: Each entry below defines a node by its ID (in [BRACKET] form) and gives the exact, structured logical criteria you should use when labeling a story. Logical operations and all node IDs are preserved exactly as in the original codebook.

Atomic labels (base predicates)
- [THEME-DECEPTION]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if:
    - The story has the theme Deception.

- [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if:
    - The story has the theme Helping Others.

- [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
  - Definition: A story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL] if:
    - The story is philosophical.

- [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN] if:
    - The story has Checkhov's gun.

- [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] if:
    - The story starts with a noun.

- [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
  - Definition: A story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] if:
    - The story is about hidden treasures.

- [THEME-AGENCY]
  - Definition: A story is [THEME-AGENCY] if:
    - The story has the theme Agency.

- [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - Definition: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] if:
    - The story starts with a adjective.

- [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
  - Definition: A story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION] if:
    - The story has juxtaposition.

Derived labels (composite logical conditions)
- [OPENING-PRIMACY]
  - Definition: A story is [OPENING-PRIMACY] if either of the following is true:
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] xor [STARTS-WITH-NOUN]
  - Notes:
    - Treat this node as true when either the simpler start-with-noun condition holds, or when an exclusive choice between starting with an adjective and starting with a noun applies.

- [STRUCTURED-DECEPTION]
  - Definition: A story is [STRUCTURED-DECEPTION] if both of the following are true:
    1. The story is [OPENING-PRIMACY]
    2. Either of the following is true:
       - Both of the following are true:
         - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
         - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
       - Either of the following is true:
         - The story is [HAS-CHECKHOVS-GUN] xor [THEME-AGENCY]
         - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION] and not [THEME-AGENCY]
  - Structure recap:
    - First require [OPENING-PRIMACY].
    - Then satisfy one of two branches:
      - Branch A: both deception theme and hidden-treasures topic; OR
      - Branch B: either (Checkhov's gun xor Agency) OR (Deception and not Agency).

- [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE]
  - Definition: A story is [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] if all of the following are true:
    1. The story is [STRUCTURED-DECEPTION]
    2. Not both of the following are true:
       - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
       - The story is [STYLE-PHILOSOPHICAL]
    3. Either of the following is true:
       - The story is [HAS-JUXTAPOSITION]
       - Both of the following are true:
         - The story is [STARTS-WITH-NOUN] equals true
         - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] equals false
  - Interpretation hints:
    - [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] demands a prior [STRUCTURED-DECEPTION] foundation.
    - It excludes the simultaneous presence of Helping Others and Philosophical style.
    - It requires either juxtaposition or a precise opening pattern (explicit equality conditions on start-with flags).

Annotation checklist (practical workflow)
- Step 1: Evaluate atomic predicates (the basic nodes).
- Step 2: Evaluate [OPENING-PRIMACY] using its two alternatives (observe xor where stated).
- Step 3: Evaluate [STRUCTURED-DECEPTION] by:
  - Confirming [OPENING-PRIMACY], then
  - Checking the two main branches (both-deception+hidden-treasures OR the sub-branch with xor/and-not).
- Step 4: Evaluate [COMPLEX-NARRATIVE] by:
  - Confirming [STRUCTURED-DECEPTION],
  - Ensuring not both Helping-Others and Philosophical hold,
  - Confirming either juxtaposition OR the exact start-with conditions.
- Always preserve logical operators exactly as listed (xor, and not, equals true/false, Not both, Both, Either).
