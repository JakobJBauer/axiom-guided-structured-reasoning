Purpose
- This codebook defines labels (nodes) that annotators apply to stories.  
- Each node below is stated as: "A story is [attr-7] if ..." followed by the precise conditions you must check.
- Logical relationships (AND, OR, NOT, XOR / "exactly one") are preserved exactly as given; conditions are arranged hierarchically to help you annotate consistently.

Nodes

- [attr-8]
  - Definition:
    - A story is [attr-8] if the story starts with an adverb.
  - Quick check:
    - Look at the first word of the story. If it is an adverb, assign this label.

- [attr-9]
  - Definition:
    - A story is [attr-9] if the story is classic.
  - Quick check:
    - Determine whether the story’s style fits classic conventions; if so, assign this label.

- [attr-4]
  - Definition:
    - A story is [attr-4] if the story has more than 375 words.
  - Quick check:
    - Count words; if > 375, assign this label.

- [attr-11]
  - Definition:
    - A story is [attr-11] if the story is about giant creatures.
  - Quick check:
    - Check whether giant creatures are a central subject; if yes, assign.

- [attr-10]
  - Definition:
    - A story is [attr-10] if the story has the theme Deception.
  - Quick check:
    - Identify deception as a core theme; if present, assign.

- [attr-12]
  - Definition:
    - A story is [attr-12] if the story is about hidden treasures.
  - Quick check:
    - If hidden treasures are central to the plot, assign this label.

Composite nodes (combinations of other nodes)

- [attr-1]
  - Definition:
    - A story is [attr-1] if all of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-4]
      - The story is [attr-11]
      - The story is not [attr-9]
  - Interpretation:
    - Requires every listed condition to hold: long length, giant creatures topic, and explicitly not classic style.

- [attr-5]
  - Definition:
    - A story is [attr-5] if all of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-10]
      - The story is [attr-12]
      - Either of the following is true:
        - The story is [attr-8]
        - The story is not [attr-9]
  - Interpretation:
    - Both theme (deception) and topic (hidden treasures) must hold, plus at least one of the two alternative conditions (starts with an adverb OR is not classic).

- [attr-3]
  - Definition:
    - A story is [attr-3] if exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [attr-1]
      - The story is [attr-5]
  - Interpretation:
    - This is an exclusive-or: assign [attr-3] only when exactly one of those composite labels applies.

- [attr-2]
  - Definition:
    - A story is [attr-2] if all of the following are true:
      - The story is [attr-3]
      - Either of the following is true:
        - The story is [attr-9]
        - The story is [attr-4]
      - The story is not [attr-8]
  - Interpretation:
    - Requires: the story to be a HYBRID-TALE; additionally it must be either classic in style or long in length; and it must not start with an adverb.

Annotator guidance (practical workflow)
- Evaluate simple nodes first (e.g., [attr-4], [attr-8], topic/theme, style).
- Use those basic labels to determine composite labels in the order given (AMPHIBIOUS-EPIC, MISLEADING-QUEST → HYBRID-TALE → COMPLEX-ARTIFACT).
- When you see nested conditions, read them as written:
  - "All of the following are true" = logical AND of the listed items.
  - "Either of the following is true" = logical OR of the listed alternatives.
  - "Exactly one of the following is true" = exclusive OR (XOR).
  - "The story is not [attr-6]" = logical NOT of that label.
- Keep each node ID exactly as shown (e.g., [attr-1]) when recording labels.

End note
- Logical structure and node IDs are preserved exactly; the above layout is intended to help you reason step-by-step while annotating.
