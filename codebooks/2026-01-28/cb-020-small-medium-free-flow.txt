Think of these labels as a small set of clear, practical tags you can apply when reading or annotating a story. I’ll name each label by its ID and then say, in plain language, the exact condition under which that label applies — keeping every logical relationship and ID exactly as they appear.

[USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
A story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT] if The story uses perfect aspect.

[TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]
A story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS] if The story is about cultural traditions.

[TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
A story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS] if The story is about the arts.

[STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]
A story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED] if The story is lighthearted.

[ARTS-TRADITIONAL]
A story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [TOPIC-THE-ARTS]
- The story is [TOPIC-CULTURAL-TRADITIONS]

[NOSTALGIC-ARTS]
A story is [NOSTALGIC-ARTS] if all of the following are true:
- The story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL]
- The story is [USES-PERFECT-ASPECT]
- The story is not [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]

[LIGHT-ARTS-TRADITION]
A story is [LIGHT-ARTS-TRADITION] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [ARTS-TRADITIONAL]
- The story is [STYLE-LIGHTHEARTED]

That’s it — concise labels, each tied to precise conditions. Use them as a checklist when you annotate: check the simple tags first ([USES-PERFECT-ASPECT], [TOPIC-*], [STYLE-*]), then derive the composite tags ([ARTS-TRADITIONAL], [NOSTALGIC-ARTS], [LIGHT-ARTS-TRADITION]) by following the listed logical requirements.
