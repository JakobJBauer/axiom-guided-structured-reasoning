Here’s the same codebook, rewritten in a more natural, conversational flow while keeping every logical connection and every node ID exactly as they were.

[attr-6]
We call a story [attr-6] when it simply reads as lighthearted.

[attr-3]
A story is tagged [attr-3] if it contains Chekhov’s gun — that detail or object that was planted earlier and becomes important later.

[attr-2]
If a story leaves you hanging at the end, it’s marked [attr-2].

[attr-9]
When a story’s central theme is hardship, it gets the label [attr-9].

[attr-10]
If the story revolves around helping others, we call it [attr-10].

[attr-8]
A story that centers on deception is tagged [attr-8].

[attr-11]
When the driving theme is figuring things out and overcoming puzzles or obstacles, the story is [attr-11].

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] when exactly one of these is true:
- The story is [attr-9]
- The story is [attr-8]

So, pick one of those themes and only one — that exclusive choice is what makes the conflict thematic.

[attr-12]
Call a story [attr-12] when both of these things happen:
- The story is [attr-6]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-7]
  - The story is [attr-11]

In plain terms: it feels lighthearted on the surface, yet it either carries a single-theme conflict (hardship vs. deception) or it’s driven by problem-solving — and both conditions together create that tonal tension.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] when both of these hold:
- The story is [attr-3]
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-11]
  - The story is [attr-2]

So a plot-driven tale uses planted elements like Chekhov’s gun and pairs that with one — and only one — of problem-solving or a cliffhanger.

[attr-4]
We call a story [attr-4] if either of these two situations applies:
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-10]
  - The story is not [attr-8]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-11]
  - The story is [attr-10]

In short: the moral arc shows up when helping others is central and not paired with deception, or when helping others and problem-solving come together.

[attr-1]
A story qualifies as [attr-1] if either of these broader configurations is met:

- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [attr-12]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is [attr-4]

  (So one path to complexity is a tone that’s conflicted, combined with plot-driven mechanics and a moral arc.)

- All of the following are true:
  - The story is not [attr-12]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [attr-5]
    - The story is [attr-2]
  - The story is not both of the following:
    - The story is [attr-9]
    - The story is [attr-8]

  (The other path: even without tonal conflict, the story is either plot-driven or ends on a cliffhanger, and it does not simultaneously carry both hardship and deception as themes.)

That’s the full set — the same logical structure and node IDs, expressed in a smoother, conversational way so it’s easier to read while remaining precise for annotation and reasoning.
