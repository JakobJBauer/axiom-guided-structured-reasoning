Interviewer: Let’s walk through this codebook together. I’ll ask about each node and you can read the rule. Ready?

Explainer: Ready.

Interviewer: What does [LOW-READABILITY] mean?

Explainer: A story is [LOW-READABILITY] if the story has readability score below 86.4

Interviewer: And [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]?

Explainer: A story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL] if the story is about time travel

Interviewer: How about [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]?

Explainer: A story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES] if the story is about seasonal changes

Interviewer: What does [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] indicate?

Explainer: A story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS] if the story uses discourse markers

Interviewer: Explain [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE].

Explainer: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE] if the story starts with a adjective

Interviewer: And [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]?

Explainer: A story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES] if the story is about hidden treasures

Interviewer: What about [THEME-DECEPTION]?

Explainer: A story is [THEME-DECEPTION] if the story has the theme Deception

Interviewer: [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] — what’s that?

Explainer: A story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS] if the story has the theme Helping Others

Interviewer: [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION], please.

Explainer: A story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION] if the story starts with a preposition

Interviewer: And [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]?

Explainer: A story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB] if the story starts with a adverb

Interviewer: Now the more complex ones. How is [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] defined?

Explainer: A story is [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] if either of the following is true:
- Exactly one of the following is true:
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADJECTIVE]
  - The story is [STARTS-WITH-ADVERB]
- Both of the following are true:
  - The story is [USES-DISCOURSE-MARKERS]
  - Either of the following is true:
    - The story is [LOW-READABILITY]
    - The story is [STARTS-WITH-PREPOSITION]

Interviewer: Let me make sure I understand—so [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] is true if either it starts with exactly one of adjective/adverb, or if it uses discourse markers and additionally is either low-readability or starts with a preposition. Correct?

Explainer: Correct. That restatement preserves the same logical structure.

Interviewer: Finally, the big one: [INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE]. How is that specified?

Explainer: A story is [INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE] if both of the following are true:
- Either of the following is true:
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
    - Exactly one of the following is true:
      - The story is [THEME-DECEPTION]
      - The story is [THEME-HELPING-OTHERS]
  - Both of the following are true:
    - The story is [TOPIC-SEASONAL-CHANGES]
    - Both of the following are true:
      - The story is [TOPIC-HIDDEN-TREASURES]
      - The story is not [TOPIC-TIME-TRAVEL]
- The story is [NARRATIVE-SURFACE]

Interviewer: So to confirm: [INSCRUTABLE-THEME-STRUCTURE] requires two things at once — first, one of two complex topic-theme combinations (either time travel with exactly one of Deception/Helping Others, or seasonal changes combined with hidden treasures while explicitly not being time travel); and second, it must satisfy the [NARRATIVE-SURFACE] condition. Right?

Explainer: Exactly. That explanation keeps the same logical relationships and operators.

Interviewer: That’s very clear. Is there anything else we should note about how to use these nodes?

Explainer: Just the practical reminders:
- Keep every node ID exactly as shown in brackets (for example, [LOW-READABILITY]).
- Preserve the logical operators and the structure when annotating or reasoning (Not, And, Or, Exactly one, Either, Both).
- Do not add or remove nodes — use this set as-is for consistent annotation.

Interviewer: Great — thanks for the walkthrough. That transcript-style presentation keeps the original logic intact and makes it easier to follow.
