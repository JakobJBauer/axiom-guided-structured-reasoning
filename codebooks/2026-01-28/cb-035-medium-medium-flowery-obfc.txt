Prologue — In a sunlit archive where ink sighs and parchment keeps its secrets, there lives a modest codex: the codebook you now hold. Picture a gentle librarian of meaning, arranging concepts like wildflowers in a meadow — each petal labelled with precision, each stem tied to another by silver threads of logic. Below, the formal prescriptions are preserved like heirloom seeds; they are spoken again here in language that blossoms, yet their architecture remains unaltered — the IDs, the operators, the exact relationships are kept as vows.

[attr-5]
A story is [attr-5] if the story is minimalist.
- In plain terms: this designation crowns a tale that pares itself down to essentials, favoring the spare and the essential over ornament — a silent room where every word matters.

[attr-4]
A story is [attr-4] if the story has readability score above 96.1.
- Here we mark those narratives whose sentences glide like polished stones — measured, clear, and scored above the precise threshold of 96.1, the golden line that separates ease from effort.

[attr-10]
A story is [attr-10] if the story uses superlative forms.
- This label is given to tales that climb to the peaks of comparison, that call things the most, the least, the finest — where language reaches toward extremes.

[attr-7]
A story is [attr-7] if the story has the theme Growth.
- The [attr-7] mark is borne by narratives that trace emergence and unfolding, the arc of change from seed to bloom, apprentice to master, smallness to stature.

[attr-9]
A story is [attr-9] if the story is about time travel.
- This token is for adventures that fold and refold chronology, where clocks are doors and history becomes a playground.

[attr-8]
A story is [attr-8] if the story is about hidden treasures.
- This is the signet of quests for buried gold, secret caches, and the glittering discoveries that alter lives and maps alike.

[attr-1]
A story is [attr-1] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-5]
- The story is [attr-4]
- When these two conditions hold together, imagine a finely trimmed hedge and a sunlit path: the story is both spare and effortlessly legible, a concise lantern that guides without excess.

[attr-3]
A story is [attr-3] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-10]
- The story is not [attr-5]
- This label applies to pieces that swell with superlatives and do so with flourish rather than restraint — the rhetoric is grand, and not confined to the minimalist’s hush.

[attr-6]
A story is [attr-6] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-7]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-9]
  - The story is [attr-8]
- Think of [attr-6] as a story that not only grows but also journeys: growth intertwined with either temporal leaps or the discovery of concealed riches, the twin paths that make a character’s maturation also an adventure.

[attr-2]
A story is [attr-2] if both of the following are true:
- The story is [attr-1]
- Either of the following is true:
  - The story is [attr-3]
  - The story is [attr-6]
- In the end, a [attr-2] story is one that shines with clarity and economy while also possessing either passionate emphasis or a growth-centered journey (with time travel or treasure at its heart). It is the tale that pulls the reader along with tidy language and irresistible purpose.

Epilogue — Let this rephrased codex be a garden map: vivid in description, faithful in compass. Every bracketed name, every logical conjunction, every negation is held in place like a cornerstone. Use it to annotate, to reason, and to celebrate stories that stand where form and content entwine.
